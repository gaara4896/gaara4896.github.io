&lt;h2 id=&quot;foreword&quot;&gt;Foreword&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several days ago, there is a meetup with my friends from high school. In meetup, I have a small discussion with one of my friend who is currently pursuing an accounting degree about future career plans. During the discussion, she told me that she is taking a professional paper, and it is extremely difficult, especially for her, who do not have any prior experience in accounting fields. So, I ask her about why does she not take any accounting part-time during any of her sem break. Her answer to that question is she hate accounting, so she wanted to delay the time she works in accounting fields and would prefer to enjoy working on other part-time jobs such as promoter or cashier during sem break instead of accounting part-time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, accounting degree holders are not limited to just accounting fields, but can also pursue a career in banking, finance, and a lot more. So I ask her if she ever considers pursuing a career in any other fields besides accounting. She then told me that she is not interested in banking or finance, but is more interested in both business law or tax. This is where the idea of this blog comes from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we think of tax, naturally we think of how can we reduce the amount of taxes we need to pay, and tax escape is one of them. One of the most popular career to pursue that are related to tax is tax consultancy, and there is a high probability of a tax consultant involved in tax escape. This can come in the form of company consultancy scope of client offline request, and meanwhile, the legitimacy of a company might be able to avoid the former, the latter is irrelevant to the legitimacy of the company one working in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My thought at that time is that there is nothing wrong with tax escape since one does not harm anyone during the process, except it’s a requirement from the government, and a law is a completely different thing from moral all together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During that night, while lying on the bed trying to sleep, I started thinking about this question, and I had come to my own conclusion to the question, which is what I am going to discuss here today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tax, by definition, is a compulsory contribution to state revenue, levied by the government on workers’ income and business profits, or added to the cost of some goods, services, and transactions. The question here is what rights do a government have for taxing workers’ income, business profits or added cost of goods and services. In order to discuss that, we need to first discuss how would a world where a government does not exist looks like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;state-of-nature&quot;&gt;State Of Nature&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;State of nature is a world where no higher hierarchy and authorities exist. In a state of nature, governments do not exist, neither do mayor, army, police, village head or any form of authorities. So, what will state of nature looks like?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Thomas Hobbes school of thought, in the state of nature, everyone has every right to everything, that which include the right to kill, the right to imprison, the right to rape, etc. Take murder, for example, the murderer is not unjust as he is merely exercising his right, neither does the victim is just, as justice does not exist in a state of nature. If one has to find just in a state of nature, it would be might. These lead to the famous quote of Thomas Hobbes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;No arts; no letters; no society; and which is worst of all, continual fear and danger of violent death; and the life of man, solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.&quot; ― Thomas Hobbes&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When there are east, there will be west. when there are good, there will be evil. When there is Thomas Hobbes school of thought, there will be Jean-Jacques Rousseau school of thought. Rousseau started with imagining a scenario where you and your friend went on to a sea trip. Somehow, some kind of accident leads you and your friends to a deserted island. There, on a deserted island, no higher authority exists, which resemble the state of nature. Would you start killing each other among your friend, or will you cooperate with each other, trying to find a way out of the deserted island? I believe most of us will choose the latter as it increases our chance of survival.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, he gives another hypothetical scenario, where there are two hunters in a jungle trying to hunt for animals, rabbit in this scenario. One day, when both of them out for hunting, they met each other. Now, they have two choices, first which is to cooperate with each other so that they can hunt down bigger prey, or they can fight with each other, chasing each other out of their “hunting ground”. If you are one of the hunters, would you go for former or latter? Most of us would say former, because by cooperating, not only we did not lose our original benefits, we gain extra benefits on top of it as it is a positive sum game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These hypothetical scenarios are where Rousseau conclude that in a state of nature, people will cooperate with each other, and it is the best state where a human can be in. However, these hypothetical scenarios have the assumption where people involved knows the benefit of cooperating with each other, and the very same hypothetical scenario is given to us, who are conditioned to live in a civilized society since born. With that assumption, we cannot conclude what kind of action would a person take when given to be in a state of nature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, unlike both the political philosophers mention above, we now live in Post-Darwin era, and we have the evolution theory, where we know that evolution happens through the natural selection. Today, we know the most basic objective of living things, which is will for survival. Maybe, and just maybe, Rousseau is right, because by cooperating with each other, it increases the chances of survival, which all of us will choose if we would have been in a state of nature and even if we are not to be conditioned by civilization since born. But, throughout history, any form of tribes or hunter-gatherer always has warred with each other. For this, we need to look at the 3 main motivation for violence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first 2 motivations are tightly related to the chances of survival. The first motivation for violence is self-defense. One uses violence for self-defense when facing violence imposed by other people, hoping to be able to survive from it. The second motivation for violence is to use violence in order to avoid being imposed on violence from other peoples. These 2 motivations are the main motivation that motivates most tribes or hunter-gatherer to exercise violence when their chances of survival are still low. So, although in the state of nature, chances of survival might increase for every person one cooperate with, there will be a point where it no longer increases the chances of survival for every extra person one cooperate with, and it might even decrease the chances of survival as more people might results in more conflicts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides, when one collective increase their chances of survival so much to the point where chances of survival are no longer taken into consideration of making choices, this will brings to the third motivation of violence, which is glory. Take a relatively big civilization, for example, perhaps with a population size of millions, chances that they are stable to a point where they no longer need to think about survival all day long are very high, and survival will no longer be the sole motivation behind every decision. Survival might still be the motivation behind starting some of the wars, the rest is for glory. To explain this, we need to look into theories that attempt to explain human behavior which we are aware of today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are 4 major theories in total, the first being discussed above, which is will to survival from Darwin. The remaining 3 are will to power from Nietzsche, will to meaning from Franklyn and will to happiness. Every single human behavior, as far as I know of, can fit into one or more of these theories, and glory potentially belongs to all 3 besides will to survival.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, if there is one thing which we can conclude, it is going to be that the state of nature, regardless of how it actually looks like, will not be able to run away from violence. This brings us to the next section, which is the role of government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;social-contract&quot;&gt;Social contract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a state of nature, everyone has every right to everything, and there are a lot of rights which will bring undesired outcome, which includes rights of imprisonment, rape, steal, kill, etc. Since these are deemed undesired by most people, and avoidance from the undesired outcome from the rights are more important than having the rights itself, this is where the function of a social contract comes in. A social contract is created when a group of people comes together, give up a certain part of their rights in order to gain protection from having other people exercising the rights. These rights that had given up will be transferred to the body which governs the social contract, in most cases, the government, and the peoples who the social contract are applied to is a citizen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To the question of what are the rights that most people willings to give up in order to get the respective benefit of it, it had been discussed for centuries by various political philosophers, and each of them has a different version of it. However, there are certain rights which are very obvious to which most of us are willings to give up in exchange for its benefit, which is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Give up the rights of violence in exchange for social peace&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Give up the rights of steal and rob in exchange for property rights&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Give up the rights of rape and murder in exchange for protection from it&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These rights that had given up by us naturally are transferred to the government and the government can exercise these rights in the event when someone violated the rights which they do not have in order to ensure the rule-abiding citizens who had given up their rights receive their respective benefits. The exercising of these rights can come in the form of imprisonment, interrogate, torture, whip punishment, death sentence, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To demonstrate it, let’s take the hypothetical scenarios created by Rousseau. An accident happens when your friend and you went on to a sea trip and ended up on a deserted island. Everyone worries about the other 6 misbehave, so all of you came to the agreement of the list of things which everyone is refrain from doing it, and if anyone violates the list, the person in question will be killed by the rest of the people. Here, since there are only 7 persons involve, it is manageable. So, all of you started a new life on the island and everything went smooth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Few days after that, an accident happens on a large cruise ship not too far away from the deserted island which resides all 7 of you. On the cruise ship, there are more than 6000 passengers, but only 1500 made their way to the deserted island which you reside. Now, the population on the island had increased from 7 to 1507. Everyone on the island now had a town hall meeting, except it isn’t in a town hall but at the side of the beach, and everyone had again come to a new and more sophisticated list of things which one refrains from doing it and each of their consequences, instead of just killing off the offender. It is all good and nice, except a population of 1507 is no longer manageable with the previous way of managing it. So, all of you had decided to pick 100 strongest person out of the population to be the “police” who collectively assume the responsibility of the government and ensure the rule of law are put in place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, without any benefits, these 100 strongest people would not carry out their job. They do not have the obligation to do so. So, the rest 1407 of the population yet again come to another agreement where every one of you will sacrifice one day worth of your production per month to a pool where it will be equally distributed to those 100 people. These 100 persons agree with the deal, and they now have the obligation to ensure the rule of law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The one day worth of production which contribute to the pool is precisely tax. To the question of why they decide it to be one day worth of production instead of a fixed amount, says, 10 coconuts, is because, within the rule, one refrain from stealing from others, and it requires much more manpower to ensure one’s 1000 coconuts to not stolen by others than one’s 5 coconuts to not be stolen by others. Naturally, it is fair that one pay more when one receive more benefits, in this case, the manpower which ensures one’s property right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, understanding all these, what does it mean for tax evasion, or in the above hypothetical scenario, secretly not paying his worth of coconuts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tax-evasion&quot;&gt;Tax Evasion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Above, we had reached the conclusion that tax is a form of payment in order to ensure the benefits in exchange for the rights we had given up. Without it, the organization that assumes the responsibility will fall apart, and when it falls apart, nothing can ensure the rule of law, and one will no longer receive any benefit upon giving up the rights. Eventually, it will go back to the state of nature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, tax evasion essentially means putting the cost of one receiving the benefits from rule of law onto others. Allow me to elaborate on that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The organization that assumes the responsibility to ensure the rule of law, in this case, the government, has the minimum cost required for operation. Take the 100 strongest people in the deserted island, the minimum cost, in that scenario, will be the resources required in order to meet their basic needs. Basic needs vary from time to time, depending on a lot of different factors, and it will not be discussed here, but we will simply assume food, shelter, and a seat on the ship which they are building for escaping the deserted island. Initially, those 1507 peoples on the island had come to the agreement to contribute one’s one day worth of production to a pool for sustaining the government (from now on we will call the 100 strongest people government) because when everyone pays their one day worth of production, it is sufficient to sustain the government. Everyone is happy for the time being.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, a few weeks after that, a small group of people stops contributing their portion of resources into the pool. Soon, the pool running low in resources, and it no longer able to sustain the 100 persons, which leads to them not as motivated as ever before. Realizing this problem, everyone gathers and have another town hall meeting. By the end of the meeting, they had again came to the new agreement, which is to contribute one and a half day worth of production into the pool every month. Slowly, more and more people stop paying their worth of resources, and the whole loop happens all over again. Clearly, those people who had successfully escape from contributing their worth of resources had shifted their portion of the contribution to those who continue contributing their production to the pool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, tax evasion is wrong because it means wanting to enjoy the benefits without exchanging what it requires to sacrifice. Equivalent exchange is the foundation everything, and to deny it is to deny the value of everything in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;counterargument&quot;&gt;Counterargument&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, you may think, what if it is not only the small group of people who stop paying their worth of contribution that leads to the lack of resources for maintaining the government, but it’s also among the 100 people who steal and misuse the resources in the pool. In that case, wouldn’t continue contributing to the pools simply means to helps those corrupted people in corruption?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To that question, people who will misuse their power will misuse their power regardless of if you contribute to the pool or not. What one should do is to contribute to the pool so as not to shift one’s portion of the contribution to other peoples, and carry out other parts of one’s responsibility in the society, which is to think about the solution to the problem, work with the government to solve it, and overthrow the government if they are too corrupted. To translate that to the real world action, it can be participating in any anti-corruption political movement, contributing to related discussions in solving the issues, actually running for a position in the government so to change it from the inside, vote during the election, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, one might also argue that there is fundamentally nothing wrong with tax evasion. What’s wrong with shifting one’s portion of the contribution to others when in nature, might is justice. Might, in this case, will be one’s resources required to successfully perform tax evasion in the very first place. It can come in the form of tax consultation fees, human resources, etc. Might is justice, and therefore, there is nothing wrong in shifting one’s contribution to other people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer to this argument is extremely simple. When one escape from paying tax, naturally the person in question also give up his benefits exchanged from paying the tax, and there will also be nothing wrong, in that case, for the government to exercise their rights in confiscating his property, as the government has higher might, and might is justice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What had been discussed here are all based on theory. In the real world, it is not going to be as straight forward as what being portray here. However, while it is not morally correct to practice tax evasion, we should also strive towards a system that minimizes morally wrong practices, such as corruption, tyranny, etc. Essentially, the future of a country is what we wish for it as a collective, and we as an individual has the power to decide what a country should be like.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Discussing tax evasion with political philosophy</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="/images/post/2019-02/tax-escape.jpg" /></entry><entry><title type="html">[意見] 關於逃稅的那件事，是對還是錯？</title><link href="/blog/%E9%97%9C%E6%96%BC%E9%80%83%E7%A8%85/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="[意見] 關於逃稅的那件事，是對還是錯？" /><published>2019-02-21T00:00:00+08:00</published><updated>2019-02-21T00:00:00+08:00</updated><id>/blog/%E9%97%9C%E6%96%BC%E9%80%83%E7%A8%85</id><content type="html" xml:base="/blog/%E9%97%9C%E6%96%BC%E9%80%83%E7%A8%85/">&lt;p&gt;如果英文是你的首選，而且也選着讀英文，可是到&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/tax-escape/&quot;&gt;這裏&lt;/a&gt;讀取英文版本的這篇文章。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;前言&quot;&gt;前言&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;前幾天，在和朋友聚會的時候，我們討論關於我們各自未來的生涯規劃。我的這個朋友正在大學就讀會記科系。她說她正在拿着一個專業文憑的考試，而且這個考試很難。她就記述了關於她的大部分同學都有一些關於會記的工作經驗，這些經驗通常都是從假期的時候做兼職拿到的。這樣一說，我們可以知道她並沒有過類似的工作經驗。很自然的我也就問她爲什麼她不在假期的時候去找類似的兼職呢？&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;聽了這個疑問之後，她就回答道那是因爲她想到畢業之後需要做同樣的工作，她就已經不想要現在做類似的工作了。與其在假期的時候尋找關於會記的兼職，她寧願尋找任何其他的兼職，好比如說：服務員，銷售員，等等。我想了一想，就讀會記科系其實不只是能夠成爲會記師，其實也可以在財務業，銀行業或其他有關聯的行業做工。所以，我便詢問道她有沒有想過財務業，銀行業或其她的行業。然後，她便回答道她並沒有對這幾個行業有興趣，而她比較有興趣的地方在稅務或商事法。這也是這個課題的由來。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;談到稅務，自然離不開逃稅了。當時，我們變談到關於大部分的人都想要逃稅，而如果進入關於稅務的行業，便很大機率將會是稅務顧問。當一個稅務顧問，就算是在一些正當的會計師事務所，好比如四大，也很有可能會牽涉到非法逃稅，只不過是在什麼的情況下發生。逃稅大概沒有對任何人造成傷害，而且這些繳的稅務也有可能會被勿用，那麼其實逃稅沒有什麼錯啊，我當時是這樣想的。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;可是，真的是如此嗎？那天回到家睡覺前，我就想了想，最終得到了我個人的答案。這答案也是我今天會在這裏討論的。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;稅務，定義爲政府強制向納稅人（個人或商業機構）征收貨幣或資源。那麼，我們應該要問的問題是政府有什麼權利徵收稅務？不過，在明白政府有什麼權利徵收稅務之前，我們要知道要明白政府的義務是什麼？而在那之前，我們要想想如果政府並不存在，會是一個什麼的樣子？&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;自然狀態&quot;&gt;自然狀態&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;自然狀態，定義爲在一個沒有任何更高等權利純在的世界，可以爲明白爲沒有政府的世界。諾今天政府突然不見了，會是什麼樣子的？&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在17世紀，有位著名的英國政治哲學家托马斯·霍布斯（Thomas Hobbes）認爲，在自然狀態，每一個人都會擁有所有的權利，這也包括偷盜，綁架，虐殺，等等。當每個人都有所有的權利的時候，對錯並不純在。一個人殺另一個人，殺害者並沒有錯，因爲他只是運用了他的權利而已，而被殺者也沒有對，因爲沒有任何的東西阻止他想盡辦法不被殺，或事先殺虐對方。這就是這位學者著名格言的由來。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;社會契約理論的奠基者、沒有了政府的自然狀態是「孤獨、貧困、污穢、野蠻和短暫的」 ― 托马斯·霍布斯&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;擁有如此極端的看法，自然也會有另一極端的看法。在18世紀，擁有另一位著名的政治哲學家讓-雅克·盧梭（Jean-Jacques Rousseau）想象一羣人出海旅遊，我們在其中。在海上乘船是，突然翻船了，而船上的人也被漂浮到一個無人島。在無人島上並不純在任何的更高權利純在，代表着自然狀態，我們會做出什麼舉動呢？試圖把這個問題問一問幾個人，我相信拿到的答案多數會是和其他船上的人合作，想想辦法先如何能夠在島上生存，然後再合作想想如果逃出這個島外。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;他再給出另一個例子。試圖想象兩個獵人在一個深林裏面打獵，各自獵人各自尋找各自的獵物：兔子。突然，這兩個獵人相遇了，而前方也有一隻大象，他們會合作狩獵這個大象，還是攻擊對方阻止對方在自己的地區打獵呢？我相信各位的答案將會是合作把這個大象成功狩獵下來。這個原因是因爲打獵並不是零和博弈，也不是負和博弈，而是正和博野。當兩個人合作是，得到的利益將會是比總合兩方各自行動得到的另一來的更多。因此，不同於托马斯·霍布斯，他總結了人在自然狀態下，人人都會幫助其他人，是人能夠在的最好的狀態。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;如今不同以往，我們擁有了居多不同的理論來解釋人類狀況，而這些狀況可以用來試圖建構自然狀態。其中之一包括查爾斯·達爾文（Charles Darwin）的自然選擇。如今，我們明白了人類最基本自然目的是生存。能夠解釋人類所有舉動其中之一的原因是爲了生存。那麼，既然如此一說，讓-雅克·盧梭錯了嗎？我個人覺得他對了一半。在自然狀態下，一個人在遇到其他人的時候，很大機率會和對方合作，因爲合作爲各自帶來更大的生存機率。可是，當這一羣人開始組織獵人部落的時候，兩個部落合作再也不會再提高生存機率。反而，在越多人的情況下，與其增加生存機率，人與人之間的關係將不會比少人的來得好，爭執也更容易發生，而且既然關係不比少人時來得好，解決爭執的動機也降低了，自然帶來較低的生存機率。這也是托马斯·霍布斯所想象的世界，只不過與其每一個人各自「孤獨、貧困、污穢、野蠻和短暫的」,而是部落與部落之間都是「孤獨、貧困、污穢、野蠻和短暫的」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不但如此，一個部落和其他部落合作不但降低各自生存機率，反而攻擊其他部落，掠奪他人的資源反而增加生存機率。一個部落沒有如我們現今先進的技術，自然很容易陷入資源短缺的狀態。剝奪他人部落資源能夠增加一個部落的資源，也更容易達到了資源充足的狀態，這樣生存機率也跟着上升。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，我們現今也明白了主要暴力的三大來源，其中是：爲了自衛而使用暴力，爲了避免對方使用暴力而事先使用暴力，和爲了榮耀。以上只考慮了前兩者原因，並沒有考慮到第三原因。除了生存，其他動機能夠解釋人類舉動的也包括：快樂，意義和權利。榮耀，在某些情況下解釋了能夠增加生存機率，生存卻不能完全解釋容易。反而，榮耀概括了其他三個人類舉動的動機：快樂，意義和權利。得到榮耀的快樂感，追求榮耀爲生存意義，最求榮耀得來的權利，這些都是在人類不需要擔心生存的時候更加在意的，即使這些動機會降低生存機率。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;那麼，自然狀態自然是逃不掉暴力了。明白了這些，政府的義務到底是什麼？&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;社會契約&quot;&gt;社會契約&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;自然狀態，暴力是否發生不重要，重要在暴力發生的可能性高不高。暴力不增加生存機率，而大部分個體都想要提高自身的生存機率遠離暴力，那麼這也就是社會契約的功能。自然狀態，每一個人都擁有所有的權利，而這些個體擁有的權力造就了我們不可取的結果，包括辛辛苦苦得來的資源被盜竊，伴侶被搶奪，家人被屠殺，等等。即使這些都是每個人不可取的結果，社會契約的功能也就是讓所有在這個契約生效的範圍內的個體給出他自身並不是很需要的權利，例如偷盜，搶劫，虐殺等等，以換取被從保護的利益。該社會契約生效的範圍也被成爲國家。所有居住在其國家內的個體也被稱爲公民。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;那麼，問題是，到底什麼權利是在一個公民願意犧牲來換取其利益呢？這一個問題是歷史以來至今所有不同的政治哲學家探討的問題。這是一個很廣的問題，所以我們今天只會專注在一些理所當然絕大多數人類願意犧牲來得到的權利，這些都包括：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;犧牲使用暴力的權利來換取社會安寧&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;犧牲偷盜和搶奪的權利來換取財產權&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;犧牲強行性行爲的權利來換取被從未經雙方認可性行爲保護&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;犧牲殺虐的權利來換取性命保障&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;這些犧牲了的權利自然會被轉遇到維持社會契約的組織，也被稱爲政府。擁有了這些權利的政府在國家必須確保所有的公民遵從不侵犯所犧牲的權利，以及確保這些公民得到從其犧牲得到的利益。諾任何公民觸犯了其犧牲的權利，政府將應用被轉與至該政府的權利來對付其犯人，這包括：逮捕，監禁，拷問，鞭刑，以及死刑。那麼簡單來說，政府的工作將會是：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;保護社會次序與安寧&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;保障財產權&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;懲處使用了不應擁有該權利的個體&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;問題來了。我們所有的公民願意犧牲權利爲得到其中的利益，可是這些利益必須由政府來保障，而其保障並非免費，這也就到我們的下一個課題：稅務。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;稅務&quot;&gt;稅務&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;政府是一個組織，組織定義爲一羣個體集合組織成爲的。政府這個組織並非慈善機構，其組織內的個體也需換取利益來執行該任務。沒了這些利益，大部分個體將不會留在其組織內，以導致此政府無法執行該應執行的義務。那麼，其組織內的個體所求利益之一也包括貨幣或其他的資源。自然地，這些需要將轉遇到受益者身上，也就是該國家的公民。那麼，徵收稅務，該從這些公民徵收多少的稅務呢？我們已經討論過了這個這個政府的義務以及公民得到的利益，那麼得到比較多利益的公民自然也應該繳比較多的稅務。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;以上其中一個政府的義務是保障財產權。越多的財產自然需要越多的資源來保護，那麼收入越高或財產越高的公民自然也應該繳較多的稅務。這裏，我們可以把一個機構同樣看待爲一羣的公民，政府依然必須確保該機構的財產權，所以機構也該依照其機構的收入來繳稅。這也就是爲什麼如今的稅務率完全取決與收入的數量。越高的收入，需繳的稅務也就越高。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;明白了這些，我們應該探討，逃稅也就意味着什麼？&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;逃稅&quot;&gt;逃稅&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;當我們購買物品，我們必須付該物品應有的價值。同樣的，想要確保自己的財產權自然需要繳付該保護財產權的代價。繳付應繳的價值以獲得該回報是天經地義。當一個人逃稅，這一就意味着一個人繳了少過他應該繳的價值。那麼，當一個人繳了少過他應繳的價值時，政府總收入減少。當絕多數人逃稅時，總收入也就降低很多，而當總收入降低到達了政府無法維持的範圍時，政府也不得增加稅務率以達到能夠維持政府機構運行的收入。這樣一來，逃稅也意味着把自己應該繳的費用轉移到了其他老實繳稅的人的身上。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;理論上雖然是這麼的一個情況，可是很多人會認爲繳付給政府的資源絕大部分都會被勿用，所以既然會被勿用，那繳稅也不就意味着幫助這些勿用稅務的人嗎？&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;可是，會勿用稅務的人始終會勿用稅務。所以，不交稅的人依然會把自己應繳的費用放在了別人的身上，因爲勿用稅務的人不會理會總稅務收入而勿用其稅務。當只有小部分的人繳稅，這些稅收入將會被這些勿用稅務的人勿用，剩下的短缺也會以提高稅務的方式來獲得。當然，勿用稅務的人並沒有對過，因爲勿用稅務也同樣的意味着把自己享福的費用放在了別人的身上，所以雖然我們不應該逃稅，我們也應該積極地支持任何反貪污的政治或非政治運動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;當然，我相信有人會認爲，把費用放在了別人的身上有什麼錯了？威力就是正義，不對嗎？就像在自然狀態下，有威力的人自然就是對的。從文明歷史以來，流傳下來的歷史都會是從擁有強大威力文明社會的角度而描述的，威力纔是正義。歷史書上記載的各文明社會榮耀繁榮，這些也不是把自己享福的費用放在了別人的身上。這樣一來，成功逃稅沒有錯，因爲逃稅來得不易，能夠成功逃稅也需要繳付該想要成功逃稅的費用，這個需繳的費用是社會權利象徵的其中一種。而付得起這個費用的人擁有把自己享福的費用轉遇到別人身上的權利，因爲他們擁有的是威力，而威力就是正義。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;依照以上邏輯，那麼停止繳交稅務也就是停止獲得政府供給的財產權，政府這時也將會有搶奪該逃稅人的財產，因爲威力是正義。所以，依照威力是權力的邏輯，逃稅依然不對，因爲在一個國家內，政府擁有最大的威力，因爲政府是所有人民轉移權利形成的，所以沒有任何一個個體會擁有比政府強大的威力，威力是正義，繳稅給政府以換得其利益自然也是正義。諾一個個體或組織擁有比該國家更大的威力時，該個體或組織將不會再有繳稅的義務，同時政府也沒有保護該組織的義務了。這時，威力才會是正義，因爲雙方不再被社會契約束縛，雙方都擁有所有的權利至另一方。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;總結&quot;&gt;總結&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;雖然威力是正義，可是在一個社會契約內，放棄了該權利的我們，威力再也不是正義。在一個社會契約內，犧牲權利來換取利益的我們雖然形成了比我們所有人更大權利的形體（政府），政府的威力也只不過是我們所有人民的總合。所以，身爲在一個社會契約內的個體，我們不應停止探討社會契約論。當政府勿用了被寄託的權力是，該國的個體也可以聚集會該犧牲的權利並且創造一個新的政府，這也被稱之爲抗議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;當然，理論上，國家和國家之間唯一存在更高權利的組織將會是一羣國家聚集在一起創造出來的組織，比如聯合國。可是，如今依然擁有不在該組織下的國家。那麼，理論上，這些國家將會有所有的權力至其他的所有的國家，而聯合國該聯盟也有所有的權利至該不在旗下的國家。但如今，大部分的國家都明白了各國家合作給予各國家的利益，加上今日戰爭的費用已經遠高於能夠獲得的利益，大部分的國家再也沒有使用所有權利至其他國家的動機了，所以我對任何國家使用該權利保持樂觀，相信未來一日，所有的國家再也沒有使用該權利的動機，因爲使用該權利的費用遠超於至今的費用，而利益也遠低於至今能獲得的利於（雖然之間利益已經遠低於費用了）。&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">探討從政治哲學的角度看逃稅，是對還是錯？</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="/images/post/2019-02/tax-escape.jpg" /></entry><entry><title type="html">[Anime] Paprika: Subconscious</title><link href="/blog/paprika-subconscious/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="[Anime] Paprika: Subconscious" /><published>2019-01-20T00:00:00+08:00</published><updated>2019-01-20T00:00:00+08:00</updated><id>/blog/paprika-subconscious</id><content type="html" xml:base="/blog/paprika-subconscious/">&lt;p&gt;Paprika is an anime released in 2006, co-written and directed by Satoshi Kon. It is a very good anime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, I had been reading quite a few that are related to psychoanalysis and dream interpretation. After that, I came across this anime, call Paprika, which I had been wanted to watch it for a long time, and finally decided to watch it right before this writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is one main takeaway which I get from the movie, which is the whole reason why I write this blog in the first place. So, without further delay, let’s get started into the summary of the movie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spoiler Alert!!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; This blog contains spoiler. If you had not watched the Anime, I strongly advise you to do so before continuing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the near future, a device call “DC Mini” is invented, allowing people going into other people dreams. This device is soon stolen by someone in order to inject dream into other people. As the plot progress, it found that the person who stole the device is no other than the chairman of the research institution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the device is incomplete, the device is faulty. Prolonged usage of the device will result in undesired consequences. Besides, no proper access control is being programmed into the device, which results in everyone can enter everyone else dream, and had been taken advantage by the dream terrorist (the chairman).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the plot progress, they try to save everyone who had been trapped inside the dream by overcoming all the obstacle. As they successfully done so, they arrive back into reality. However, when they are back to reality, they soon found that reality had merged with the dream. The creature of the dream are everywhere, and everyone started to dream and turning into various dream personas. It is chaos everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon after that, the chairman had gone back to reality as a giant monster and attempt to destroy the world. Lastly, Atsuka and Paprika merge back into one being, sucking out the chairman dream, thus defeating the chairman and return to the world back to reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;my-main-takeaway&quot;&gt;My Main Takeaway&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the final part of the movie, where the detective finally is able to overcome his repressed trauma, and shoot the terrorist, all the dream had ended. Everyone who trapped inside the dream went back to reality. However, something wrong happens. The reality had merged with the dream, and everyone, in reality, is dreaming while they are awake. All the dolls, festival, marching group, and many more, which originally only appear in the dream, appear out in the reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result of it, chaos. People who are originally in the reality started to become a part of the dream, turn into some weird persona and merge into the march or doing whatever they do not dare to do in the reality, such as performing some violent activity or overthrow the people on top of the hierarchy. There are cars running into buildings everywhere, there is also robot eating up others human (Tokita’s persona as a giant robot, eat Atsuko after seeing her).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, I started to think, a dream is our repressed conscious, and dream appears as a dream because our conscious had lower it’s guard when we are sleeping, hence came our repressed conscious. We repress our conscious every single day. When we read a piece of news about corruption happening in our government, we repressed the anger instead of expressing the anger toward people around us by punching them. When we are scolded by a teacher/lecturer/boss for doing something wrong, we, again, repress it instead of expressing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conscious that we had repress is not just limited to the scenarios that are as big as had been mentioned above, it can even be something as small as not being late to work/class where the emotion of not wanting to go early are being repressed, or not opening the angpao immediately after receiving one because culture restriction, where the desire or opening it are being repressed. Of course, in order for dream-formation, there need to be much more condition to fulfill, which will not be discussed here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we dream while awake, it simply means release all our repressed conscious to the reality and expressing it through any form of action. Perhaps, in order to maintain order, or letting a society works, each and everyone of us has to repress a certain part of our conscious. The thought of being able to dream while awake will result in nothing but chaos. Since each and every one of us has to repress some of our conscious, repressing too much will eventually meeting a backslash, which this is where the function of a dream comes in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Jung, the function of a dream is integrating conscious and unconscious, and he called it individuation. Take the detective, for example, his repressed conscious of making a movie are revealed to him in his dream, thus giving him a chance of achieving his dream and letting him become the individual he wanted to be. Therefore, the moment when the detective shot the terrorist, it is the moment when his conscious merging with his unconscious, successfully achieving his dream, it is also the end of the dream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same applied to Freud’s theory of dream at the later stage of his career. Despite earlier in his career, his theory of the function of a dream is to grant wishes that the dream owner wishes subconsciously, he found that dream can act as a function of giving a chance of fulfilling a dream and overcome trauma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, my main takeaway in the movie is dream contribute to us subconsciously much more than what most of us aware of, and we should never think about integrating dream into reality, as they are meant to complement each other and to think that is to result in nothing but chaos.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">What happen when dream merge with reality?</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="/images/post/2019-01/paprika.png" /></entry><entry><title type="html">[Book] Book Rewind 2018 &amp;amp;#x1F44F &amp;amp;#x1F44F</title><link href="/blog/book-rewind-2018/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="[Book] Book Rewind 2018 &amp;#x1F44F &amp;#x1F44F" /><published>2019-01-09T00:00:00+08:00</published><updated>2019-01-09T00:00:00+08:00</updated><id>/blog/book-rewind-2018</id><content type="html" xml:base="/blog/book-rewind-2018/">&lt;p&gt;It’s the first day of 2019 and happy new year! Our life expectancy, since the moment of this writing, had officially decreased by another year, again! So, let’s hope we have another great year coming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the title implies, it’s a rewind of the books that I had read over the past year. Over the past year, I had read a number of books, and this blog will be a short review of these books that I had read during that period. Although it’s a book rewind for 2018, the first few books which I mention here might be books I read at the end of 2017 but I had forgotten when do I read them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;1---utopia-merlin-coverley&quot;&gt;#1 - Utopia, Merlin Coverley&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image left&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/post/2019-01/book-utopia.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Utopia&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first book in this list is Utopia, written by Merlin Coverley. This is a book where I bought the end of 2017 in Big Bad Wolf at The Mines. At that time, I am very interested in anything related to philosophy. I went to Big Bad Wolf, thinking to buy a few books which are related to philosophy and start the journey of philosophy. So, this is one of the books I bought, together with The Great Philosophers by Stephen Laws, The Year 1000 by Robert Lacey, Apocalypse by John Michael Greer and The Path by Michael Puett.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I didn’t manage to finish Apocalypse due to unfamiliarity with history. However, I finish The Great Philosophers before reading this book. It is an introductory book to philosophy, cover numerous famous philosophers and a summary of their idea. Since I read this book in 2017, it will not be discussed here. The Year 1000 and The Path, on the other hand, will be discussed in the later part of this blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, wandering in Big Bad Wolf, I came across this book, name Utopia. “Utopia, the perfect world, interesting topic, what does the writer has to say about it”, so I thought and I bought that book. Utopia is a book that discusses numerous different utopian ideas. As I am yet a frequent reader at that time, it is not an easy read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the book, it discusses numbers of utopian idea introduce by past people, often philosophers and writers. As the book discusses these ideas in a chronological order of which the idea had been introduced by the original person who came up with the idea, we can see how these ideas evolve, becoming more and more sophisticated over time. This is mainly due to people improving their idea on top of the insights provided by the people in the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there is a common characteristic of these utopian societies, which is while it might sound like a utopian to the people it the past, it sounds rather dystopian today. By changing perspective, an utopian may turn into a dystopian. These ideas are utopian ideas during that period are potentially due to the social status, cultures and living condition of that period. By looking at the utopian idea of the period, it reflects the culture of that period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, the existence of good creates the existence of evil. Good and evil is nothing but the different side of the same coin. In a world where good does not exist, evil too will cease to exists, due to the relatives of evil to the good no longer exists. Perhaps, these ideas are accepted as an utopian society in the past, means nothing but the living condition of that period are simply far worse than the utopian society itself. Looking back at it, we have nothing but to be grateful that we are born in this period. Probably, people in the future, looking back to the current ideal society, feels the same as how we look at the past utopian ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2---the-year-1000-robert-lacey&quot;&gt;#2 - The Year 1000, Robert Lacey&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image left&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/post/2019-01/book-year-1000.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Year 1000&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second book, The Year 1000 by Robert Lacey. The Year 1000 is a book that talks about how does life in the year 1000 look like. As mention above, I bought this book during Big Bad Wolf. I already forget why do I buy this book during that time. It is probably because “Wow the first millennium, how can a cave life even elaborate into a whole book?” or “Wow how does life in the first millennium looks like back then when they do not have any technology?”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can guess from what I had said, the first millennium is probably much more technological advance than I think of them before I read the book. Certainly, I forget some of the Chinese Civilization, Ancient Greek Civilization, and another Civilization comes before the first millennium, where they no longer live in a cave or to live a life of stone age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book is made up of 12 chapters, and you guess it, each chapter represents how life looks like at each month of the year. Certainly, it is a very different period to live in comparison to ours. One of the examples would be the month before the harvest season. In the book, the author calls the months “the hunger gap”, where it is the month where there is a shortage of food, and the gap between the poor and the rich are more obvious than never before. Besides, there is also a festival celebrating the harvest season, where there is an abundance of food. Unlike today, where we have an abundance of food 365 days per year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3---the-path-michael-puett--christine-gross-loh&quot;&gt;#3 - The Path, Michael Puett &amp;amp; Christine Gross-Loh&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image left&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/post/2019-01/book-the-path.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The Path&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third book, The Path, yet another book I bought in Big Bad Wolf. The Path is a book about Ancient Chinese Philosophy. The reason why I buy this book is that it is one of the little books that I can find in Big Bad Wolf about philosophy, and I also have some interest in Chinese philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a Chinese myself, it feels weird to read a book about Ancient Chinese Philosopher from a western writer. Certainly, the writer of the book is a professor of Chinese History at Harvard University. Without a doubt, he certainly knows more about Chinese culture, history, and philosophy than me. It is a very good book, and it did change some of the perspectives on how I look at things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we talk about Ancient Philosophy, what comes to a lot of people mind is outdated, non-practical, irrelevant, dogma, etc. While the impression of non-practical, dogma and irrelevant may mainly come from branches like metaphysics or related branches, irrelevant and outdated might still be a concern for a modern reader. However, the writer does aware of these factors, and the book mainly concerns itself about the practical aspect of Ancient Chinese philosophies that are still relevant to us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these philosophies came from more than a millennium, there are still a lot where we can learn from them. Back then, their science, logic, mathematics, physics, psychology, etc, might not be as developed as we do today, however, they still need to deal with human relationship, life, hardship, etc, just like us. By learning as-if ritual by Confucious, it might give us a different perspective on looking at a relationship. By learning Mencius philosophy, we learn a different perspective on looking at making choices. By learning inward training, we learn yet another perspective on looking at the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Far from the conventional impression on ancient philosophies, these philosophies not only far from irrelevant, but they are also relevant to us that it can give us extra perspectives. The more perspective we get to look at things, the more objective we can on making the right decision, instead of just blindly reacting to our emotion. This will without a doubt a book that I will recommend to people, especially if they are new to philosophy and not a frequent reader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;4---beyond-good--evil-friedrich-nietzsche&quot;&gt;#4 - Beyond Good &amp;amp; Evil, Friedrich Nietzsche&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image left&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/post/2019-01/book-beyond-good-and-evil.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Beyond Good &amp;amp; Evil&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next book, Beyond Good &amp;amp; Evil by Friedrich Nietzsche. This is a philosophy book about ideas that Nietzsche expands on his previous work, Thus Spoke Zarathustra.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As naive as I could, I thought I would be able to understand the book at that time, bought the book, and start reading it. It is still one of the most difficult books to read up until today, along with Thus Spoke Zarathustra, yet another book of him. Before reading this book, I had finished a few other philosophy books, full of myself, believing that I can do the same for this book, grasp everything idea inside, not knowing what actually is waiting for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, reading the book, I am able to understand why so many people misunderstood him. Those are mainly due to taking his word out of context. It is also very interesting to read some of the ideas about Übermensch before reading a book specifically about the said concept. But, as difficult as the book is, there are some of the chapters that I believe I will never be able to understand it, mainly due to the requirement of understanding the German culture itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe that even now I am still not prepared to read the book. I will come back to this book again in the future when I think I am more prepared, and hopefully able to understand more than the first read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;5---nineteen-eighty-four-george-orwell&quot;&gt;#5 - Nineteen Eighty-Four, George Orwell&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image left&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/post/2019-01/book-1984.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;1984&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next book, 1984. 1984 is the first fiction appear in the list. 1984 is a dystopian totalitarian fiction written by George Orwell, which I had already done 2 blogs about it, namely &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/book-1984-social-construct/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/book-1984-thought-and-mind/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Up till today, it is still one of my favorite books. The journey of reading the book is surely one of the most interesting journeys you can have. It is not just the plot that is interesting, the ideas that discuss inside are also interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The whole book is a vision of the dark future the author have if the world continues pushing the communism narratives. This cannot be blamed because the author lives in the world where there are Soviet Union, Hitler, Communist Party of China and Communism of North Korea. Lucky as we are, the world learns from history, knowing what can go wrong, and many people putting efforts into avoiding such things happen again every single day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is another book which a lot of people always contrast it against this book, which is Brave New World by Aldous Huxley. It is another dystopian totalitarian novel, but having a complete, almost opposite concepts of what 1984 have. It’s been difficult to get on hand one of them, but I wish I can get on hand one of them as soon as possible, read it and make a comparison between both of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;6---the-prince-machiavelli&quot;&gt;#6 - The Prince, Machiavelli&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image left&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/post/2019-01/book-the-prince.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The Prince&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sixth book, The Prince by Machiavelli. The prince is a book about politics that written specifically for new prince of the time on how they should manage a country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Machiavellianism is a word used to describe someone with dark personalities, duplicitous interpersonal style, lack of morality and lack of empathy. The reason for the word having such meaning is mainly due to this book, The Prince.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the prince, it teaches the political theory that takes any means necessary to keep one in power. It talks about how morality differs from one person to another, and the prince naturally should have a different set of morality from normal people. To see why people hate those theories, one of the theory advice the prince to command his subordinate to exercise violence during a politically unstable period and betray the subordinate at the time when politics had come stable, making him a leader which people like by sacrificing the subordinate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are certainly not acceptable by the moral standard of the majority of the people. However, we need to understand where Machiavelli came from. He lives in a period of extreme political instability, and people at that time wish for nothing but political stability. This is why he wrote this book. In fact, he also wrote other books about the republic where he favors more than a monarch. The book, in my opinion, is merely a product of instability of the time, and he will also not agree with it during a stable political period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;7---a-guide-to-the-good-life-william-birvine&quot;&gt;#7 - A Guide To The Good Life, William B.Irvine&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image left&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/post/2019-01/book-guide-to-good-life-stoicism.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Stoicism&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next book is A Guide To The Good Life by William B.Irvine. This is a book about Stoicism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stoicism is a life philosophy. Life philosophy is important because it guides you to live the most out of your life, just like a compass guide you to your destination in a journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The history of stoicism is dated back to ancient Greek. Just like ancient Chinese philosophy, there might be some of the things that are outdated, but this book is the version that focuses on parts which are relevant to us. Not only that, but this book also spend a lot of time addressing common criticism towards Stoicism. Such an example would be demonstrated below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the common practice in stoicism is to always expect the negative outcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;When you wake up in the morning, tell yourself: the people I deal with today will be meddling, ungrateful, arrogant, dishonest, jealous and surly. They are like this because they can't tell good from evil. But I have seen the beauty of good, and the ugliness of evil, and have recognized that the wrongdoer has a nature related to my own - not of the same blood and birth, but the same mind, and possessing a share of the divine. And so none of them can hurt me. No one can implicate me in ugliness. Nor can I feel angry at my relative, or hate him. We were born to work together like feet, hands and eyes, like the two rows of teeth, upper and lower. To obstruct each other is unnatural. To feel anger at someone, to turn your back on him: these are unnatural.&quot; ― Marcus Aurelius, Meditations &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These practice advice to always expect the negative outcome, such as you will lose your job, your girlfriend will leave you, etc. By having this negative outcome, if it did happen, you will not feel as sad as you would have expected the outcome otherwise. However, if the outcome is otherwise, it would simply be a bonus, and you will feel happy about it. This practice is commonly being criticized by others with the argument goes: if you do not shed a tear when you look at your child past away, you would not have the happiness seeing your first born child smile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the book, it addresses the argument by expecting the negative outcome, for instance thinking your child is going to past away, you will treasure the current time with your child more than if you had not expected such. This book not only addresses common criticism people gave to stoicism, but it also improves on top of the existing stoicism method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is just one of the example from the book, which one will require to take a lot of reading from a lot of different books about stoicism to come to such an understanding. This is because there is hardly one book that covers most part of stoicism, as complete as this book, and yet, at the very same time, the modern version of it. Hence, the writer decides to compose a single book that covers most essence of stoicism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This book, in my opinion, this is a book where everyone needs to read. However, it does not mean that everyone should practice Stoicism after reading it. There is a lot of philosophy of life, ranging from Epicureanism, Hedonism, Cynicism, etc. However, after reading this book, to practice Stoicism or not is totally up to the reader, as he is the one who lives his life, and it would benefit one to know the existence of Stoicism, if not the philosophy of life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;8---leviathan-thomas-hobbes&quot;&gt;#8 - Leviathan, Thomas Hobbes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image left&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/post/2019-01/book-leviathan.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Leviathan&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet another philosophy book, Leviathan, by political philosopher Thomas Hobbes. This book is about political philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we talk about political philosophy, the name that comes to our mind would be Hobbes, Rousseau, and Locke. All 3 of them comes up with a very different political philosophy theory. To discuss the reason behind why they arrive at different theory, we need to understand what is political philosophy in the very first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Political philosophy discusses about the role of government. When we discuss the role of government, we first need to think of what does it looks like if the government does not exists. When we know what does it looks like when a government does not exist, and we understand what we want our government to be like, then we can only discuss about what is the roles of government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, as you guess, all 3 political philosophers mentioned had a very different view on the state of nature, which is a state where any form of greater power than an individual does not exist. In Hobbes view, in the state of nature, human will kill each other in order to survive. In Rousseau however, humans are good and will help each other by nature in order to survive. On the other hand, John Locke thinks that humans are born with certain human right. All of these leads to very different opinion on political philosophy theory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of people today will criticize them for their wrong theory, however, eventually, they are living in the pre-Darwinism period. Now, we know, in the state of nature, we might help each other or kill each other, totally depending on the situation for the sake of survival, but they do not have such inspiration to build their idea on top of it. So, these theories might be no longer relevant, however, understanding their reasoning might help in understanding political philosophy in today’s context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;9---in-the-orchard-the-swallows-peter-hobbs&quot;&gt;#9 - In The Orchard, The Swallows, Peter Hobbs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image left&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/post/2019-01/book-in-the-orchard-the-swallows.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;In the orchard, the swallows&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second fiction in the list, In The Orchard, The Swallows by Peter Hobbs. The book talks about a story of a young man who gets into tragic after some romance relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the book, the story goes by a young man who falls in love with a woman. For the woman came from a family of a different social class with the protagonist, he gets into some argument with the woman’s father, and eventually sent to jail without explanation from the authority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the book, we can see how social class and separate human being into a superior and inferior group is inhuman. But, what most important of all, is meaning. In the number of years where the protagonist able withstands to live within the jail, all of these are due to the belief where he can see the woman when he leaves the jail. It is the meaning, that helps him withstand the years in the jail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;He who has a why to live for can bear almost any how.&quot; ― Friedrich Nietzsche&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This point is being shown in the novel. A lot of part of the novel narrates how the protagonist withstands all the sufferings that he has within the jail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;10---understanding-objectivism-leonard-peikoff&quot;&gt;#10 - Understanding Objectivism, Leonard Peikoff&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image left&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/post/2019-01/book-understanding-objectivism.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Understanding Objectivism&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, yet another philosophy book, Understanding Objectivism by Leonard Peikoff. This is a book, not written by Leonard Peikoff, but a text version of Leonard Peikoff lecture class on Objectivism. The book composes of the whole semester of Leonard Peikoff’s Objectivism lecture with minor changes on the way of organizing and grouping things to suit for reading. Such minor changes are simple things like grouping the question asked in the lecture class to the end of the chapter, or something similar, hence preserving the presence of Leonard Peikoff in the lecture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several very useful things discussed in the book that can greatly improve our lives, which include epistemology, subjective versus objective and the use of logic and emotion. By understanding epistemology, it helps us better in understanding and learning things or even reasoning. A lot of people, not understanding subjective and objective, while making an argument without understanding both is a waste of time. Objectivity should be looking at things in a way that putting as little our own perspective as possible, looking at one thing as it is. Meanwhile, subjective is looking at things from a particular perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to reach subjectivity, it requires to pass through the argument of objectivity. For example, randomly go on a street killing people in a civilization context is objectively wrong because Social Contract exists, protecting us from randomly getting killed by giving up our own right of killing other people. To randomly go on a street killing people is to go against own life because doing so would simply causing one to either get killed by other people in self-defense on the street or death sentences. So, when not passing objectivity, there is no need to discuss subjectivity or one preference of going on a street randomly killing people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, choosing a career between an artist and programmer is subjective, because both options are not objectively wrong, and both at the very same time objectively right for one who made the career choice as a career allow one to preserve his own life by earning wages and pay for necessity. However, once it reaches the realm of subjectivity, there is again, no need of argument, because it is simply up to the perspective or one preference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book also discusses about the use of both emotion and logic. One main reason pushing people away from practicing philosophy is they think that practicing philosophy means to use only logic, not emotion. However, there are different usage in both emotion and logic. Emotion act as a tool for us to hold a lot of information, while logic act as a tool of cognitive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To demonstrate it, say, when we went to listen to a speech, the speaker will give out a lot of points. Here, emotion act as a tool for us to remember a lot of crucial information, such as we get angry when the speaker giving out a certain point, which all the point gave out by the speaker is able to compress into the emotion: anger. Post-speech, logic comes into play to evaluate the speech, where we evaluate our emotion, examining whether why do we have such emotional reaction and should the points given by speaker correct or wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To conclude, I think this is a very useful and practical book. There are of course a lot another point that being discussed in the book, and above is merely a few of the very useful point being discussed. I believe this book able to allow more people to be more objective about things, and I would surely recommend everyone to read this book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;11---thus-spoke-zarathustra-friedrich-nietzsche&quot;&gt;#11 - Thus Spoke Zarathustra, Friedrich Nietzsche&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image left&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/post/2019-01/book-thus-spoke-zarathustra.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Thus Spoke Zarathustra&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next book, the third fiction in the list, Thus Spoke Zarathustra by Friedrich Nietzsche. Forgetting the lesson learned from the first book of Nietzsche, I think, “maybe fiction is easier to read”, hence I started reading the book. Learning lesson is part of our life, but forgetting the lesson we learn, maybe, is also a major part of our life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, this book follows a man, Zarathustra, goes on a journey of creating an Übermensch. He stays deep inside the mountain, acquires a bunch of wisdom, going down to the town, trying to preach his idea, and eventually meet a backslash from the people. He then moves on to the journey of finding people who suit to be Übermensch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This book, fiction, is slightly easier to read than Beyond Good and Evil, but the reason why I can understand better for this book is that while I reading the book, every time finishing a chapter, I will read the interpretation of the chapter online, and cross-reference with my own interpretation. Here, finally, I realize, why his book is so difficult to read. When he uses the word “the wise”, it does not signify someone who is wise, rather someone who deem wise by the majority of people. When he uses the word “virtue”, he does not meant it as “virtue” as the word represent, but the virtue being adopted by the masses. The way he uses the word makes it difficult to read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plus, it is also not the easiest book to read. The book is not well structured. He wrote the book in a very short period of time, and only further expand the idea in the books Beyond Good &amp;amp; Evil and Genealogy of Moral.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a book for everyone, but also a book for no one. He knows that this is a book where everyone needs to read, but also knows that when people read his books, the majority of people will not be able to fully understand him intellectually, or misunderstood him. Although I am the former, I still think this is a very good book to read, and reading this book allow us to put down a lot of burdens that being placed on us since born, and also encourage one to strive towards the best version of oneself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;12---before-the-fact-francis-iles&quot;&gt;#12 - Before The Fact, Francis Iles&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image left&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/post/2019-01/book-before-the-fact.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Before The Fact&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More and more fiction now, Before The Fact by Francis Iles. This is a novel with the story goes by a woman who married to a murderer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of the story, a woman, if I remember correctly, in the late twenties or early thirties, somewhat desperate for a partner, and eventually meet a man who seems to love her very much. They get married very soon after that. As the story progress, the women slowly found out that there is a lot of secrets that the man hiding from her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The title goes “before the fact”, indicating that this women, due to how desperate she is, despite the fact that a lot of proof point against his husband, she still tries to believe the otherwise, and eventually found out that his husband is a murderer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, this is a tales of how emotional can a human being be, and what are the consequences one might need to face when using emotion for the wrong things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;13---eureka-chad-orzel&quot;&gt;#13 - Eureka!, Chad Orzel&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image left&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/post/2019-01/book-eureka.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Eureka&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 13th book is Eureka!, the first book in the list that is related to science. Eureka! is a book about scientific thinking and aim to discover the inner scientist of the reader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the book, the scientific method is described to the following few steps, include observe, hypothesize, testing and sharing. Every scientific discovery started with observing the phenomena. Once a phenomenon had been observed, the next step is to think and hypothesize why the phenomenon happens so. After that, it will be testing out the hypothesis if it is correct. A lot of people thinks the process stops after proving the hypothesis to be correct, but it doesn’t stop here, and the final step of the process is to share the result, hence making scientific advancement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main point of the book is not about the scientific method itself, but how often in our life we use the scientific method. Example, the first step of the scientific method is to observe, and naturally, observe involve collecting data. Biologist effort of collecting numbers of different species hoping to complete collecting every species is exactly the same with stamp collector trying to collect a full collection of stamps or we trying to collect achievement in games. The same goes to hypothesize, testing and sharing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we end, quote Orzel Chad, “Like breathing, we are engaging in the scientific process much of the time, even if we don’t know it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;14---animal-farm-george-orwell&quot;&gt;#14 - Animal Farm, George Orwell&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image left&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/post/2019-01/book-animal-farm.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Animal Farm&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As George Orwell’s 1984 fascinates me a lot, it makes me wanted to read him more. After that, I came across another of his book, Animal Farm, and I think to myself, “this sounds interesting”, so I bought it and started reading it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Different from 1984, this novel seems like a version of 1984 that had been simplified by a lot. While 1984 has a very complete world setting, with a government, different social classes, etc, animal farm simply happens in an animal farm with different animals living in it. If the main idea behind 1984 is to tell people how scary it would be to live in a world of totalitarian state, Animal Farm will be a book to describe how a state can turn into a totalitarian state like one in 1984.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book started with animal trying to take over the farm from being colonized by the human, upon success, the leader of the protest become the leader of the animal farm. As the story progress, the leader of the animal farm slowly changing more and more rules to their own benefit, and eventually reach a state where it is no longer better than when human colonize the farm, instead even worse than that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, as the animal in the farm ages, and slowly dying, replacing with the next generation, it reaches a point where there’s no longer anyone who remember the life when human colonize the animal farm, and eventually it ends with the leader of the farm show their true face and sided with the human.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not a happy story, but it shows us in the real world, how a politician can manipulate people into their own benefit, and slowly taking over the country, warning us to be more cautious of such situation, thus avoiding from living in such scary state in the very first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;15---the-rational-optimist-matt-ridley&quot;&gt;#15 - The Rational Optimist, Matt Ridley&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image left&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/post/2019-01/book-rational-optimist.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Rational Optimist&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I previously read a lot of pessimistic books, I wonder to myself, maybe I should read a few optimistic books. Looking into the list of book I have, I saw this book, The Rational Optimist by Matt Ridley, which I had bought it for some time and haven’t read it, so I decided to start reading this book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the title suggests, the author of the book is not naturally optimist nor pessimist, he is simply being an optimist after looking at the facts, numbers, data, figures, etc, on the subject where most people pessimist about. All of this, include global warming, population growth, food shortage, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main point of the book is not global warming does not exist, not population growth is not an issue, neither food shortage never happen, but the trend of these issues are not as pessimistic as what the media portray them to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take population growth, for example, population growth used to be a problem many years ago, perhaps late 20th century, but many countries in the world showing them otherwise. However, although we say a lot of countries no longer has population growth, most population growth came from Africa, and they still have population growth up until today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this is also a point where the author aware of, and we should not ignore the fact that most of these country’s population are increasing at a decreasing rate, and as more and more of these places equip with more advanced medical facilities, they will eventually reach very low or negative population growth rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, there are also things that we should be pessimistic about, such as matter concern with a nuclear weapon. Current Nuclear technology is so advance that the nuclear bomb today is far stronger than both of the nuclear bomb that dropped during world war 2 combined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main point of the book is eventually about we shouldn’t be as pessimistic as most people is on the matter where a lot of people pessimistic about. Things such as population growth, food shortage, global warming, and many more, is a real problem, and we should not just leave it alone, treating it as if it is not a problem, but neither should we be very pessimistic about it as what most media portraying them to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;16---antifragile-nassim-nicholas-taleb&quot;&gt;#16 - Antifragile, Nassim Nicholas Taleb&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image left&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/post/2019-01/book-antifragile.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Antifragile&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next book is Antifragile by Nassim Nicholas Taleb. This is a book about the whole concept of antifragile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this book, it talks about antifragile and contrast antifragile with fragile and robust. When we think of fragile, we think of something that breaks easily. So, if the word antifragile is completely opposite to fragile, what is antifragile? Most people will say: “doesn’t break easily”. It is actually not, but antifragile is something that can benefit from trying to break it, while something that doesn’t break easily is robust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, the author gives a lot of examples of fragile, robust and antifragile. What most of the time we think as robust of even antifragile is actually something completely opposite to it. First, he demonstrates with a self-employed with an employee. In a lot of people perception, self-employed have a much higher risk than being employed, where while self-employed has a very unstable income, an employed has stable income every single month. However, when we look at most self-employed, they do have unstable income, but at a longer time frame, the average income for said period is slightly less stable, if not equally stable with those that are employed, but once in an unfavorable condition, an employed can loss all the income meanwhile self-employed will still have a certain amount of income.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, it is here that makes a difference, where if an employed loses his job, say, at the late 40s, he will have a hard time recover from it, but not the same for self-employed. The self-employed, at a hard time, will be forced to improve himself to compete in order to survive, thus becoming the better version of himself, and on top of recovering back to the original position before the difficult period, he would have strived even further than before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, employed are fragile, while one will have stable income if the economy remains stable, he will be hurt deeply and will be difficult to recover once hurt, where the antifragile, in this case, the self-employed, has a very high potential of gaining from the bad time as long as he is not hurt to the extent where he does not have any chance of recovering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, the same concept can be applied to a lot of things, not just from those that mention in the book, but far beyond on that. It is a very good book, at least to the first half of the book, but the second half of the book becomes a book where there is a lot of self-contradictory statement, hence if one would like to read this book, I would advise to read it more critical than reading any other books.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;17---world-order-henry-kissinger&quot;&gt;#17 - World Order, Henry Kissinger&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image left&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/post/2019-01/book-world-order.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;World Order&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we reach the last few books. Here we have World Order by Henry Kissinger. This is a book about the subject of world order. The book explains different world order in historical context and the evolution of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, the book started with Westphalian Peace during 17th century Europe. He explains how the system is in place for keeping the world order. After that, it moves on to explain central imperium philosophy of China, then the theory of world order from an Islamic state, and lastly move on to the democratic idealism of the United State.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although I mention quite a few of them above, the proportion that used to cover each is surely not the same, and a big part of the book is used to cover the democratic idealism of the United State. This makes me think nothing but this is a book that written to push the narratives of world order from the United State perspective to the rest of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite that, as I did mention where I am not very well versed in history, this book does help me to equip with some historical knowledge, which is unexpected out of the book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;18---the-women-in-the-dunes-kobo-abe&quot;&gt;#18 - The Women In The Dunes, Kobo Abe&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image left&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/post/2019-01/book-women-in-the-dunes.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The Women in the Dunes&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At almost the end of the year, I started reading this book, The Women in the Dunes, and finish it within 2 days. If you aware of the blogs that I have, I had already written a &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/book-suna-no-onna-absurdism/&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; for this book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is one of the fiction books that I had read which make me realize the if I only read non-fiction, I will be missing out a lot. Although saying such, there is, of course, a lot of fiction that is written solely for the purpose of entertainment without any depth towards it. Other fictions which make me think so is 1984 and animal farm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, there is a lot of theme in the book aside from absurdism, such as spiritual rape, sexual desire, etc. All I cover in my blog is just one of the theme in the book, which is absurdism. It is a short but interesting read, and I believe that you might get different things out of the book from me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;19---no-longer-human-osamu-dazai&quot;&gt;#19 - No Longer Human, Osamu Dazai&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image left&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/post/2019-01/book-no-longer-human.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;No Longer Human&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I finish The women in the dunes in 2 days, what else I finish in 2 days? It’s No Longer Human by Osamu Dazai.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is another interesting book to read, written by an author who had attempted suicide several times before writing this book, and finally successfully suicide after finishing this book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are aware of it, I had also written a &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/book-no-longer-human-review/&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; for this book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After reading this book, you will sort of understands how the author thinks, and perhaps why he does what he does. A lot of things about him are hidden from everyone else, like putting a facade and living on for the rest of his life. Of course, as another entity, we will never know how they think at that moment, and it is only through their own writing, we get to know potentially how he think at a moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, it is a fictionize autobiography of the author, and not everything inside is exactly what the author had experience, but through the writing, we at least know that to the very least, it’s something happen to him or people around him. It is a very interesting book to read, and I would surely recommend it if someone asking recommendation for fiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;20---mans-search-for-meaning-victor-efrankl&quot;&gt;#20 - Man’s Search For Meaning, Victor E.Frankl&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image left&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/post/2019-01/book-man-search-for-meaning.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Man Search For Meaning&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second last book, Man’s Search For Meaning by Victor E.Frankl. This is a book about introductory to his logotherapy which we will be discussed slightly later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The author of this book is one of the survival in concentration camps during the Hitler period. In the book, he describes his experience in the concentration camp and what he sees within. He sees a lot of people who lost their meaning of life and eventually run into the fence (suicide by running into the high voltage fence). He also describes a lot of people who suddenly lost their meaning of life, and no longer want to live and just await the arrival of death. On the contrast, he also sees a lot of people with the strong will of survival. One of the common characteristics he sees within those is having a meaning of life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Life inside is extremely horrible. One only get a new pair of shoe every 6 months, regardless if the old shoe is still able to wear. If the shoe had been broken, even during winter, they have to went to work barefoot, working as hard labor. Also, they only get 2 meal per day, a piece of bread in the morning while a bowl of soup in the evening. With this amount of calories intake, they will without a doubt run into calories deficit, especially when their nature of work burns an extra amount of calories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagining a life inside a concentration camp, any reader, including me, without a doubt, has very high possibility having the thought that if we would be in their position we would have suicide long ago. The reason they had yet suicide is simply the meaning of life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;He who has a why to live for can bear almost any how.&quot; ― Friedrich Nietzsche&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Logotherapy is essentially a method surround meaning. “Logo” in Greek is meaning, and logotherapy is a method where meaning is the center of the therapy. One of the perspective the book offer us is not to see what life has to offer to us, we have to see what we can offer to life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case of concentration camp, when we are hit by such hardship, we shouldn’t think of life no longer has anything to offer to us, but what we have to offer to life, which is a sacred opportunity that life provides to us to prove to it that we are able to overcome such hardship and become someone better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After reading this book, it is also where I realize such had been used in another book within this list: In The Orchard, The Swallows. In the book, the protagonist, constantly thinking about the one he loves, and eventually able to survive the time in the prison.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although we keep saying meaning, it is not the kind of grand meaning of life, but rather the meaning to every event. For instance, the meaning of suffering in the gym is because one wants to become strong. Grand meaning of life is indeed difficult to even find one, but having all these meaning for all different event is so that in return hoping that one can find one meaning by almost the end of life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;21---the-hero-with-a-thousand-faces-joseph-campbell&quot;&gt;#21 - The Hero With A Thousand Faces, Joseph Campbell&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image left&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/post/2019-01/book-the-hero-with-a-thousand-face.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The Hero With A Thousand Faces&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, we reach the last book of the list, which is The Hero With A Thousand Faces. This is a book that discusses about the general journey of hero in a lot of myths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, the journey of the myth can separate into 3 parts, which is departure, initiation and return.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of the journey, the hero will go on to an adventure. This can cause by many different factors, such as being cast away by his people or searching for power to defeat the more powerful villain. For example, in the recent Aquaman, the protagonist went on a journey to search for the legendary weapon. In Iron Man, being blast away, he went on to work on his Iron Man suit. In Bleach, during the Aizen Sousuke ark, the protagonist went on to learn the final Getsuga Tenshou. Buddha, after finding out life is suffering, he went on to an adventure in order to search for the truth. And the list continues…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that, it will be the initiation. In the initiation stage, the hero will face several challenges that test him to see if he is capable of being a hero. Example, Aquaman, when searching for the legendary weapon, he faces the challenges of activating the secret message, decodes the message in the bottle, defeat the small villain, breaking through the trench, and lastly, face the legendary monster who guard the weapon. In Iron Man, it will be the technical challenges he faces making the suit. In Bleach, it will be the battle against the Hollow Zangetsu within him. For Buddha, it will be the difficulties he faces meditating trying to find the truth, and also the devil that came to disturb him from becoming a Buddha. And of course, the list continues…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final stage is the return. This is the stage upon when the hero attains the power, he returns back to the people and performs his hero duty. For example, in Aquaman, it will be uniting both the land and sea and avoid war coming from the sea. For Iron Man, it is defeating the villain. For Bleach, it is defeating Aizen Sousuke, who no one in the world can defeat him. For Buddha, it is not to defeat anyone, but to teach the people the wisdom that had gifted upon him. Of course, the list again goes on…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the book, there is a lot more detailed analysis of myths, which impossible to put into this summary. This summary merely covers the surface of the book. In all the detailed analysis, it uses a lot of psychoanalysis jargon, which makes it a difficult read for people who are not well versed with psychoanalysis. However, this is also a book where it gives me extra fun watching Aquaman, which I would enjoy less originally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;end&quot;&gt;End&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s the end of the blog. In last year, I had read 21 books, which I am quite satisfied with. This year, hopefully, I can finish 36 books by the end of this year. Also, as you might aware, I had been reading a lot of non-fiction past year. In this year, I also want to read more fiction and some science-related book, especially quantum physics.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Yaaaah!

It had become one of my favorite anime after watching it. Generally, when comparing episodic anime to serial anime, I would prefer a serial anime except for genre like comedy. However, there are 2 anime which is surely suited more like an episodic anime than a serial anime. They are キノの旅 (Kino no Tabi) and Cowboy Bebop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What makes this 2 anime so great as an episodic anime is the feeling of having the journey together with the protagonist of the anime. In Kino no Tabi, the protagonist, Kino, is a traveler who travels around the world and has a rule of staying only 3 days in every town he visited. So, every episode is like an experience in a new town together with the protagonist. It feels as if you visit a new town, see new things about the town, experience their culture, food, etc. It’s almost like the feeling of you actually traveling to a place where you never travel before, except the anime can have much more interesting concepts that can never happen in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same goes to Cowboy Bebop. Cowboy Bebop is an anime about space bounty hunter traveling around to hunt for bounty. Life of a bounty hunter is very much like a freelancer, where they get a new job from time to time, and they never have a fixed job or fixed income. So, most of the project is short, and every project is like a journey, and it is a repetition of starting a new project, doing it, and finishing the project. The same goes to a bounty hunter, where new bounty being announced to the public, then comes the journey of trying to hunt the target down, and finally either a success or failure. What different from this anime to Kino no Tabi is when Kino no Tabi is an anime where protagonist visiting a new town every episode, and rarely side character appears more than 1 episode, Cowboy Bebop get the character development of all 4 main characters (one of them is a dog).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the anime’s episode goes from one after another, more and more character development happens. Slowly from one episode to another, we learn more about each of the character, their hobby, personality, characteristics, and even their past. From one episode to another, we also learn about the development of the relationship between one character and another. As the anime advances, more and more events take place, and new concepts being introduced to the anime, and these will be discussed in this blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This blog contains spoilers, but these spoilers generally will not spoil your watching experience of the anime if you decide to watch it in the future as the anime is episodic anime, so continue as you wish to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;hedgehog-dilemma&quot;&gt;Hedgehog Dilemma&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hedgehog dilemma is a concept where I first came across when watching Neon Genesis Evangelion. When watching the anime, I had not fully understood it. At the time, I understand Hedgehog Dilemma at the definition level, but could not able to relate and have a conceptual understanding of Hedgehog Dilemma. Thanks to this anime, a few other books, interaction with peoples, etc, I finally able to has a deeper understanding of Hedgehog Dilemma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image right&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/post/2018-12/hedgehog.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Hedgehog&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we talk about hedgehog dilemma, we need to know what is a hedgehog. Hedgehog is an animal with a lot of spikes at their back. These spike act as a defense mechanism for them when danger arises. When a hedgehog sense danger, they will roll themselves up, leaving the spike at the back pointing outwards, thus protecting their vulnerable part and exposing the invulnerable part. If an enemy tries to attack them when they are in defensive mode, they will be injured by the spike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, 2 hedgehogs out in the wild, meeting each other while wandering in the forest they live in when looking for shelter. It is almost winter, near the end of the autumn season. Both of the hedgehogs feel very cold walking alone out in the wild due to the cold ambient temperature. Looking into each other eyes, they decide to hug with each other to preserve the warm of their body. Here, the dilemma arises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image left&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/post/2018-12/hedgehog-dilemma.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Hedgehog Dilemma&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If both of the hedgehogs hug with each other, the spike on their body will hurt each other. Doing otherwise however would simply mean suffering the freezing sensation from the loss of body temperature. Either choice they make, they will hurt each other regardlessly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A human does not simply hurt each other physically by standing close to each other, but the same happens to a human in the psychology level. Human tend to hurt each other when they get too close. This is contributed by a lot of factors, one which includes taken for granted for each other beings. We tend to appreciate more for a person who is nice to you compare to someone who is very close to you. This is because when someone close to us does us something good, it is just another day where they are being good to us. The same does not apply to someone who is not very close to us, where when they does us something good, it is not usual, not just another day, and it is a special day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, there are also other factors that contribute to the hedgehog dilemma. When two humans have a very close relationship with each other, expectation would be different for both of them. The way they treat each other would also be different at the very same time. Different attitude will take place, and the relationship looks as if it had transformed into something that is completely different from when their relationship gets started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, we had only considered the situation where seemingly can be avoided with good training on handling relationship with other people, setting the right expectation, not taken for granted, etc. Let’s consider a situation where the relationship happens across a pair of enlightened individuals. These two individuals are extremely well versed with psychology. They are also extremely good in interpersonal communication skills. However, conflict may still arise due to misunderstanding. So long as these two individuals remain two different individuals, they will have different thoughts, a different definition of words and required to exchange thought by using any form of signs. It is not until both of them become a single person, conflicts will always arise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To put it simply, hedgehog dilemma is a dilemma where despite goodwill appear between two or more individuals, conflicts will still happen, and it is the nature of human interaction itself. Each and every one of us has different thoughts, a different definition of words, different personality and different ways of expressing ourselves. All of these could easily lead to conflicts. All of these had yet take into consideration where people with bad will exists. Conflicts arise due to the selfishness of these people. Selfish by itself is not necessarily inherently bad things, but it can be undesirable when it is done in a way that it affects other people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the anime, various conflicts arise throughout the whole journey. These conflicts often arise even when all of them have goodwill by helping each other to sustain in the bounty hunter business. Although the reason they do it is so that in turn they have a higher probability in sustaining themselves in the business, it would consider as goodwill here because it is a win-win situation. One of the examples would be when the protagonist, Spike, wanted to go when he overheard an operation name to be his lover name. His partner, out of good will, knowing that going there would bring nothing good to him, trying to stop him, yet eventually end up as an argument.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In real life, we often have conflicts with our family and friends. Conflicts can arise with matters as small as some small habit to education path or career choice. Our family has a different set of experience, more so especially for you and your parents. They live through different times, different eras, and a different set of culture apply to them compare to yours. They have a very different thought due to the environment around them that they have lived through. The career choice in the past is obvious where you are either doctor, engineer, lawyer or disgrace to the family. The same might not apply in today’s world. However, we cannot deny the fact that their concern is nevertheless out of goodwill. These conflicts simply arise due to different experience between you and your family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In business, there are a lot of cases where one become good friends with their client. When they get very close in relationship, people tend to treat each other as normal friends instead of a professional. These can eventually lead to conflicts due to expectations.  For an employer-employee relationship, when conflicts happen at non work hour, these conflicts can bring over to work hour, which in turn negatively affect the outcome of work. These can be avoided for individuals who are good and handling conflicts and able to separate personal and work matter, not bringing such vibe into work hours, however, most people don’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image right&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/post/2018-12/smart-memes.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Smart&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, conflicts happen so long as one cannot know what others think, and everyone remains as a separate entity. So, is there a way to avoid conflicts? Maybe, if interaction does not happen in the very first place, no conflicts will take place. Se-mat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smart, not so smart, humans being is essentially a social animal. A human being needs other human beings in order to survive their day to day routine. In hunter-gatherer tribe, one need another human being to take care of some of their needs, while they take care of other needs of another human being. For instance, some of the people in the tribe will be a weapon maker, some will be a hunter, some will be fruits collector and many more. A hunter cannot live on their own. They need weapons that made by weapon maker and fruits collected by fruits collector when they are not able to make a hunt for that day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That goes even without saying for today’s world. The device that you are using to read this post, the chair you are sitting on or the bed you are lying on, the clothes that you are wearing, the eyeglasses if you are wearing one, the lighting device that light up the room that you are in, the fan or air-conditioning that brings down the temperature of the place where you are in, the electricity that delivered to your place in order to power whatever you need it to and the very house or building that you are in, all of these is the product of thousands, if not millions of people, ranging from the scientists who took research in order to discover new concepts and hence making whatever you have possible, the engineer who engineer these concepts to what is it now, the workers who work to obtain raw material needed to construct whatever end product, the factory worker who assemble different parts into the actual final product, the lorry driver who deliver these products to the stores which sell them, the promoter who sells the product, and the list goes on. A simple pencil that you uses every single day can involve thousands of people. To say you need no human interaction is to say living in the wild alone, getting your own foods, drinks, and shelter, living a self-sufficient life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To have interactions is to have conflicts, to not to have interactions is to go back to a fully self-sufficient life. Our life cannot avoid from neither human interaction nor conflict. Human interaction and conflict perhaps is an essential part of human life. Here, we had only cover physiological needs. We had yet dive into the realm of psychological needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are social animal not just from the perspective of the physiological needs, but also psychological needs. We need other human beings to interact with. We need to express our thought, our opinion, our stress. We also need other human beings to comfort us and letting us know that we are not alone. By simply knowing that we are not alone, this can be easily turned into strength and motivation to overcome whatever obstacle we are facing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An example from the Anime would be the episode where when Spike insists on pursuing a transaction with the code name of his lover. His partner trying to stop him, knowing that nothing good will turns out. Yet, eventually, it turns into an argument. his partner asking him not to come back once he went out, stating that he only letting him stay because he thinks that Spike is lonely. Spike, in turn, telling him that he stay simply because he thinks that his partner is the one who is lonely. After leaving, both of them feel nostalgic for the time they spend together. They both think each other feels lonely simply because they themselves know how it feels to be lonely, hence able to understand each other. It might happen subconsciously, not knowing that thinking each other feels lonely simply because they themselves, too, are lonely. Eventually, they realize it, when both of them start feeling lonely themselves and feel nostalgic for the time they spend together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what a lot of people do is to keep a certain distance with other people in order to maintain the best relationship possible. Like the hedgehog, hugging each other would mean hurting each other, while leaving each other would be freeze to death in the cold, staying in a close distance that enough for heat exchange yet not hurting each other would be the best for both parties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In business, keeping a certain distance would mean treating each other as professionals and not turn into close friend and in turn to have a different set of expectation compare to a close friend. Employer keeping a certain distance with an employee will avoid bringing the vibe of conflicts in personal space into work time due to each individual treating each other as professional. A boundary is being drawn, and that is the boundary which keeps each other in best interest possible. While getting too close in a relationship can break the relationship apart, yet we need to have some relationships at all, keeping a relationship certain distance at the same time would mean letting the relationship the closest possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, exceptions do happen. One can maintain a close relationship without breaking apart when both individuals are enlightened individuals. The ultimate goals here is to train ourselves into an enlightened individual, and able to have a close relationship with other enlightened individuals when meeting with one. To put it in hedgehog metaphor, it would be taking out the hedgehog outfit aside and hugging with each other thus getting the most out of heat preservation yet not hurting each other. As mention above, conflicts will still arise so long as these individuals are two separate entities, but an enlightened individual will be able to resolve this conflicts, and in turn, getting the relationship to even closer than ever. To turn conflicts into strengths thus is the ultimate goals of every relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My blog will end here, and if you have some spare time, I would surely recommend you to watch the anime. I assure you that you will not regret watching it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See You Space Cowboy…&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I'm going there to find out if I'm really alive.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="/images/post/2018-12/spike.jpeg" /></entry><entry><title type="html">[Book] Review: No Longer Human</title><link href="/blog/book-no-longer-human-review/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="[Book] Review: No Longer Human" /><published>2018-12-09T00:00:00+08:00</published><updated>2018-12-09T00:00:00+08:00</updated><id>/blog/book-no-longer-human-review</id><content type="html" xml:base="/blog/book-no-longer-human-review/">&lt;p&gt;人間失格, also known as No Longer Human is a book written by Osamu Dazai. It is a book that I bought last week (from the time of this writing) and also another book that I finish in 2 days. It is a really good book, and when I finish the book, I knew that I wanted to write a review of this book. This blog, unlike any other blogs that I had written before, is a review of the book instead of some very technical analysis on the subject being discussed. Part of the reason is that this book is believed to be a fictionize autobiography of the author himself as a lot of things happen on the protagonist happens on the author at some point of his life, and it is a story narrating how alienated he is from other people. Another reason is that while there is not a lot to analyze, feelings gain from reading the book is more important than trying to analyze and interpret it as correct as possible. What more important and charming in this book is to experience the character (or the author) feelings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book started with when the protagonist is still a child. When he is a child, he already has a sense of alienation from other people. This is partly due to a strict culture which Japanese stick on to. The protagonist, unable to understand the inference of these cultures, started to feel more and more distant from other people. This eventually leads to protagonist putting on a facade where he pretending to be a clown so he could avoid trouble with other people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The vibe of alienation just goes on the whole book. In the book, Japanese culture sort of act as a very important part of the book, like how Japanese hold on to the pride of something above even relationship connected with blood. This, perhaps, also contribute to the process of alienation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, the protagonist put on a facade where he pretending to be a clown. He will purposely learn the behavior or some comedian, learn the joke to tell people, or even purposely embarrass himself to achieve the comedy effect. There is one time when he is in high school, during physical education period, where they do some kind of pull up, he purposely fall on the floor so people could laugh at it. However, there is this one classmate who sees through him for putting on the facade. This makes him feel so scared that he tries to do a lot of things to get the person onto his side so that no people will know about him putting on the facade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What happened after that is he successfully make friend with the person. What very interesting about this book is the self-consciousness of the protagonist in the whole book. The protagonist is very conscious about his behavior of putting on the facade, every detail of inner thought that went through him, and he felt right after whatever happened. The thought process of the protagonist makes this book so interesting. It makes you not only able to see the face value of the story, but also from the first person perspective from the protagonist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s very interesting to be able to see why the protagonist do what he does. Throughout the story, the protagonist knows that he is very attractive towards women. At one point in the novel, the protagonist is addicted to alcohol for escaping his existential vacuum. However, the protagonist runs out of money, yet he still went to one of the bars where he knows a woman inside is attracted to him to ask for sake. He went in, told the women he doesn’t have a single cents, and the woman treats him with sake and slept with the women after that. The thought process of the protagonist wanting to drink alcohol, thinking about those women which love him, and thinking about how to get alcohol and how he treats the women that love him, everything is just so interesting about this book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most interesting of all is how he interacts with people that he knows where they are having the same alienation inner thought. It’s very hard to even imagine living such lives. Such precise inner thought might only be possible because these are exactly the same thought that the author had experience throughout his life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, there isn’t proof that the author had experienced the exact inner thought. However, many things that happen in the novel had happened to the author at one point in his life. In the novel, the protagonist attempt suicide with a woman by jumping into the river. The protagonist survived but the woman had died, and he is charged for accomplice suicide and disowned by his family. The very same thing happen to the author where he suicides with a bar hostess Shimeko Tanabe. The bar hostess died and he survives and is charged for accomplice suicide and disowned by family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At one point in the novel, the wife of the protagonist is raped by a stranger. In the novel, the protagonist saw it and did not take any action against that. The author’s wife committed adultery with one of his best friends when he is in a mental institution, and they commit double suicide after author finding out the events. There are a lot of similarities between the character and the author himself, and these are just 2 out of many examples. The lists of evidence can go on and I make no attempt to exhaust the evidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, it is a very interesting book. When the author finishes writing this book, he makes another attempt to suicide and finally succeeded upon numerous suicide attempt. Certainly, it is not a very happy book, but I think it is a very nice book to read and to be able to sort of experience a journey which is completely different from us. I rate this book 10/10, and if you are interested in this book, grab it from any bookstore or contact me and borrow from me and I would be happy to do so.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Last book written before a successfull suicide</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="/images/post/2018-12/no-longer-human-photograph.jpg" /></entry><entry><title type="html">[Book] Suna no Onna: Absurdism</title><link href="/blog/book-suna-no-onna-absurdism/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="[Book] Suna no Onna: Absurdism" /><published>2018-11-22T00:00:00+08:00</published><updated>2018-11-22T00:00:00+08:00</updated><id>/blog/book-suna-no-onna-absurdism</id><content type="html" xml:base="/blog/book-suna-no-onna-absurdism/">&lt;p&gt;Recently, I had finished reading a book call 砂の女 (The Woman in the Dunes) by Kobo Abe. It is a very interesting book. I started the book after being recommended by Pewdiepie in his book review youtube video. Initially, I start reading the book without having a really high expectation, thinking it is just a random book that recommended by Pewdiepie, because it is not that famous due to I had not heard the name before (it is more famous than I think).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After reading it, it turns out to be so much better than my expectation. People call Kobo Abe the Kafka of Japan, but since I had not read any Kafka before, I cannot really comment on that. It is a really good book overall, talking about all kind of concepts, some which I still do not fully grasp it yet, such as the soap opera and spiritual rape that is used as a metaphor for describing the women in our current time. It is a very good book, and I finish the whole book within 2 days. So, in this blog, I will write about my interpretation of the absurdism in the novel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spoiler Alert!!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Again, this blog contains spoiler. If you had not read the book, I strongly advise you to do so before continuing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story started with a man, Nikki Junpei, goes on an expedition to collect insects. Reaching the destination, he started his pursuit of collecting bugs that exhibit in sand dunes. Approaching the end of the day, he saw several villagers and had been told that he misses the last bus home. Suggested by the villagers, he decided to stay a night in the village.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The villager guides him to a house in a dune, where a woman lives inside there. While they are exchanging conversation, the villager brought a shovel and some cans. Upon curiosity, he asked what is that for, and no answer was given from her. Soon after that, the woman goes out from the house and start clearing out the sand with the shovel. Upon sympathy, the man offers help in clearing out the sand. At that moment, he realizes his behavior is expected by the villager, and that is what the shovel and cans for. Despite, he starts helping and finish the first round of sand clearing. He has then been told that there are going to be more rounds after that. For him, seemingly, clearing the sand is meaningless, as doing so would nevertheless trying to resist against the characteristic of sand, he went to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Waking up, the rope stair to the outside of dunes had been removed. The day after that is a series of escape planning coming from Nikki. He tried several escape methods, including pretending to be sick, negotiating with the villager, making a rope, swinging it to the sandbag and climb out, etc. However, none of them succeeded. At the end of the story, he obsessed with the “hope” (water trap created by him), and having the chance to escape, he no longer trying to escape, but rather choosing to stay inside for advancing the “hope”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;absurdism&quot;&gt;Absurdism&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main theme of the whole book, I believe, is absurdism. This had been the recurring theme throughout the whole book. However, what is absurdism?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In philosophy, &quot;the Absurd&quot; refers to the conflict between the human tendency to seek inherent value and meaning in life and the human inability to find any in a purposeless, meaningless or chaotic and irrational universe. The universe and the human mind do not each separately cause the Absurd, but rather, the Absurd arises by the contradictory nature of the two existing simultaneously.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image left&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/post/2018-11/sisyphus.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Sisyphus by Franz Stuck&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To put it in a simpler word, absurdism believe there is no inherent value in the universe, and any search of inherent meaning is directly contradicted with the inherent meaningless of the universe, and creating meaning is only possible when one accepts the absurdity of the universe. This can be understood with Sisyphus from Greek mythology, who is a king of Ephyra, punished to push a giant rock up a hill and only to have it push back to the bottom of the hill for eternity. One will never be able to find meaning in rolling a rock up to a hill only to have it push back, making the previous action utterly meaningless. What is the meaning of it, if the action is to be undone in the end anyway? Any search of the meaning of pushing the rock to the top of the hill nevertheless, directly contradicts with the meaningless of the action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, you may think, how is absurdism different from nihilism or any other type of existentialism. Below is a table to explain the differences of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;

      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Yes, but only after accepting the absurdity of meaningless&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;No&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;There is a resolution to one’s desire of searching meaning&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Yes, the creation of one own meaning&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Yea, the creation of one own meaning involve god&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Embracing meaning is eventually annihilation by death&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;No&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Absurdism is in parallel to the premise of the story, which is the sand will always come back no matter how many times it had been cleared. There is no end to clearing the sand, and the sand will always gather, and it has to be repeated forever, or the village will be submerged into the sea of sand. Clearing the sand is as meaningless as it might as well not to be done at all, as it will be undone at the end of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pushing giant rock to the top of the hill, or clearing the sand in the dunes seems utterly meaningless to us, but in our life, we do a lot of things that are meaningless to us. It may not seem obvious to us, but at one point of the story, it had been obvious to the protagonist of the story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
    The newspaper was the same as usual. He wondered if there had been a gap of a week, for there was almost nothing new to be found. If this was a window on the world outside, the glass was frosted.

    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
    There wasn't a single item of importance. A tower of illusion, all of it, made of illusory bricks and full of holes. If life were made up only of important things, it really would be a dangerous house of glass, scarcely to be handled carelessly. But everyday life was exactly like the headlines. And so everybody, knowing the meaninglessness of existence, sets the center of his compass at his own home. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image right&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/post/2018-11/headlines.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Headlines&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon stuck inside the dunes for several days, every headline in the newspaper seems so meaningless to him. Here, I am not saying news that reported by the newspaper is meaningless to us. However, in the age where everything is breaking news, and news company such as CNN are more entertainment organization than an actual news organization, how many headlines are actually meaningful to us? News regarding country policy, foreign affairs, economics, all of these might be related to you in one way or another, and related to you more depending on your position, but what about news of some celebrities?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image left&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/post/2018-11/absurb-social-painting.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Absurb social painting&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Taylor Swift dating her 7th boyfriend, Hailey Baldwin confirms marriage to Justin Bieber, Jennifer Garner, and Ben Affleck Get Divorced&lt;/em&gt;, these had been the most meaningless headlines ever, but are made headline nevertheless, and being spread by people as if something big happened. People read the news every single day, looking at the headlines, reading the content of it, finishing reading all of it, feeling content and move on to the rest of the day as if nothing happens. People never question why do they do it in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of these meaningless things had not been obvious to us that it is meaningless, because we had never questioned the meaning of it. So, is it all of it? Just now, I mention the different level of importance of reading news regarding the sort of things like economics, foreign affairs, country policy, are to the different individual, and all of these are going back to one’s position. One’s position as a prime minister makes matter regarding country policy extremely important to them. One’s position as a fund manager makes matter regarding economics extremely important to them. One’s position as a farmer makes matter regarding weather important to them. Hence, the importance of news, are nevertheless, back to the work that one does for a living, which brings us to the next point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Do you shovel to survive, or survive to shovel?&quot; ― Nikki Junpei &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no ending to shovel, and there is no meaning to shovel at the very same time. The woman life as though she survives to shovel, that is if surviving under dunes itself has no meaning. Life in the dunes is nothing, but a repetition of clearing sand, cooking, eating, sleeping, clearing sand again. If not had been for shovel, she would have no meaning of life. However, at the very same time, shovel itself has no meaning to her. Did she shovel to survive, or survive to shovel?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This perfectly resembles the life of most people. People work to earn money, as though money would give them happiness, but would end up needing to earn more money in the name of “happiness”, and to do more work. The question of do they work to survive or survive to work, if the question is presented to them, they would have told you that they work to survive, but what is the meaning of surviving in the first place? Assuming it would be happiness, wouldn’t the hedonistic treadmill simply render the meaning of surviving meaninglessly?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;And so, one bit one's nails, unable to find contentment in the simple beating of one's heart... one smoked, unable to be satisfied with the rhythm of one's brain... one had the shakes, unable to find satisfaction in sex alone. Breathing, walking, bowel movements, daily schedules, Sundays coming every seven days, final exams after every four months, far from quieting him, had had the effect rather of pushing him toward a new repetition of them.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image right&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/post/2018-11/hedonic-threadmill.png&quot; alt=&quot;Absurb social painting&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One work to survive, and the meaning of surviving lays in the happiness, and unable to attain happiness causing by the wrong expectation leading to a hedonistic treadmill. The whole repetition, nevertheless, exhausts one, but the driving force of pushing one to the new repetition, nevertheless, is the “false hope” that are gifted to them. Sounds familiar? Yes, if you had read the blog &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/book-1984-social-construct/&quot;&gt;1984: Social Construct&lt;/a&gt;. Weekend, holiday, break, annual trip, is nothing but false hope that acts as a driving force that pushes one to the new repetition of the meaningless and absurd cycle. Why one has to work if work only to survive, and there is no meaning of survival in the first place?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Work seemed something fundamental for man, something which enabled him to endure the aimless flight of time.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe, and just maybe, one survive to work? It is work, that makes one able to ensure the aimless flight of time? Like the women in the dunes, who, without shovel, would nevertheless unable to endure all the time she has to pass? It is only because shovel, at that moment, that, she do not have to think about anything else, but shovel? Maybe, the same for most people in our modern period?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;One could not do without repetition in life, like the beating of the heart, but it was also true that the beating of the heart was not all there was to life.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wouldn’t it not make sense, if one to survive just to work, just like all it is for life, is beating of heart? Perhaps, survive to work would nevertheless make surviving itself meaningless, while work to survive would be meaningless if there is no meaning to survive, which wouldn’t it just make the whole thing absurd?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;He was like an animal who finally sees that the crack in the fence it was trying to escape through is in reality merely the entrance to its cage –like a fish who at last realizes, after bumping its nose numberless time, that the glass of the goldfish bowl is a wall.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, it is absurd. It is meaningless to work to survive, and the same goes to survive to work. However, Albert Camus does provide a solution to this absurdity, which is to recognize and accept the absurdity, finding and creating meaning for ourselves out of it, while still aware that all of these will eventually annihilate by death and turn meaningless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;From the moment absurdity is recognized, it becomes a passion, the most harrowing of all.&quot; ― Albert Camus&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the novel, after Nikki Junpei fail to escape from the dunes, had finally recognized and accept the absurdity of the whole thing. It is at this moment that he no longer bound by absurdity, trying to create meaning for himself by living to as much capacity as he has by doing scientific research of making the water trap “hope” for gathering water from the sand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The only way to go beyond work is through work. It is not that work itself is valuable; we surmount work by work. The real value of work lies in the strength of self-denial.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He creates more work for himself, such as helping out with the craft so they can save up money to buy a radio, making and advancing the water trap so it can gather more gallons water per day so that he can have meaning to life. These work, I would interpret it in a way that it is no longer just work, but had been turned into a passion. In this stage, the distinction between work and non-work no longer exists, and that is the only way to go beyond work by work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
    There was no particular need to hurry about escaping. On the two-way ticket he held in his hand now, the destination and time of departure were blanks for him to fill in as he wished. In addition, he realized that he was bursting with a desire to talk to someone about the water trap. And if he wanted to talk about it, there wouldn't be better listeners than the villagers. He would end by telling someone—if not today, then tomorrow. 
    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
    He might as well put off his escape until sometime after that. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the end, when the work goes beyond work, and the work is no longer work, but passion. He did not even want to escape when he has the opportunity to do so. All he cares now is to live to his full capacity, continue engineer the water trap, and to talk to people about the water trap itself. All of these work, eventually, will become meaningless after death. However, would it matter anymore, if it is just absurd anyway, and one can certain about meaning while he is still alive, because once dead, it is not his concern anymore.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Do you shovel to survive, or survive to shovel?</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="/images/post/2018-11/dunes.png" /></entry><entry><title type="html">[Opinion] FA / TA: Investment</title><link href="/blog/investment-fa-or-ta/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="[Opinion] FA / TA: Investment" /><published>2018-11-16T00:00:00+08:00</published><updated>2018-11-16T00:00:00+08:00</updated><id>/blog/investment-fa-or-ta</id><content type="html" xml:base="/blog/investment-fa-or-ta/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/strong&gt;, Before we start this blog, I have to mention that I am not an investment professional or expert, nor do I have CFA or any other equivalent financial analysis certification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had been investing in the stock market for more than 3 years. For the past 3 years, the method I use to analyze stock is fundamental analysis. Before I start investing, I had been always interested in learning how to invest money because I find the idea of using money generating more money is attracting. So, when I get into college, I join a club in my university, call SBIS (Sunway Business and Investment Club). After that, I start to attend different investment talk and workshop. From all these workshops, I learn a various method of analyzing investment instrument, primarily for the stock market. All of these methods of investing can be categorized into 2 category, which is fundamental analysis and technical analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;fundamental-analysis&quot;&gt;Fundamental Analysis&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Fundamental analysis is a method of evaluating a security in an attempt to assess its intrinsic value, by examining related economic, financial, and other qualitative and quantitative factors.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, fundamental analysis is the method of analyzing any investment instrument based on the underlying value of it. For stock market particularly, there are 2 approaches, top-down and bottom-up approach. A top-down approach is the method of filtering company from the strength of the economy which the country based on, then filtering with the sector performance, and finally each individual company. , however, analyze based on each individual company. In a bottom-up approach, country economy strength and sector strength lesser being taken into consideration. Example of such value is EBITA, P/E ratio, market capitalization, yield, ROE in bottom-up approach or GDP, unemployed rate, the interest rate for the top-down approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Benjamin Graham, author of “The Intelligent Investor”, is the father of value investing. Warran Buffet, third wealthiest person in the world (as of the writing time), gain his wealth from the method created by Benjamin Grahham. Fundamentally, value investing analyze based on fundamental analysis, which is looking at the intrinsic value of a stock, hence the name “value” investing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;In the short run, the market is a voting machine but in the long run, it is a weighing machine.&quot; — Benjamin Graham&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In value investing, they do not care about short-term volatility. They believe that in long run, investment instrument with high intrinsic value will automatically raise in price, and hence generating profit to the investor. Therefore, value investing only invest in an investment instrument that has a higher intrinsic value than the offering price. Let’s make an analogy that resembling value investing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suppose you walk in a street, and there is an auction ongoing. In the auction, there are 2 products that are open to bidding. Suppose below is the technical information of the 2 product and the current bid while you reach there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt; &lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Product A&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Product B&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Product Type&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Wallet&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Wallet&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Contains object&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;RM200&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;RM1000&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Current highest bid&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;RM300&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;RM300&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Number of people in the audience&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;50&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Number of people wanting to bid&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;15&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to value investing, you should always bid for product B because the intrinsic value of the product B (RM1000) is higher than the market price. Well, you may say that any reasonable people would do so, but what if it is not so straightforward, instead of money, it’s item with values inside, and it is something that only when you look deep into it, you can know the intrinsic value, then you will start worrying about the resell value of the product (since it is less popular) and buying the first object seems like getting you something that everyone wants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the real world, product B does exists in the past but no longer exists today due to easy attain of information. However, investment is not so straightforward in the real world. Meanwhile, a company has assets, company generate more assets over time, which it makes thing more complicated in investing. Suppose a wallet contains RM300, and will generate RM10 per month, cost at RM500, it is justified to buy according to value investing (considering you will start making a profit on top of your initial investment after 20 months).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, product A does exist, and value investing is not just about investing in product B, but never investing in product A. A example of product A in real life will be Snap Inc, also known as Snapchat. Before Snapchat IPO, it has a valuation of 3 billion. Yes, 3 billion, while still getting 0 profit and do not have a revenue model! After IPO, during the first day of trading, it’s market capitalization soar to almost 20 billion. To put it in simpler perspective, if you are buying the whole company, it will cost you almost 20 billion, while buying a company that not only does not make any profit but making losses at the very same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, is buying product A justified? Why do people buying it? Also, when should you buy product A and not buying it? To understand this, we will need to look at technical analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;technical-analysis&quot;&gt;Technical Analysis&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Technical analysis is a trading discipline employed to evaluate investments and identify trading opportunities by analyzing statistical trends gathered from trading activity, such as price movement and volume.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To put it in a simple word, technical analysis analyzes the trends and earning money by either following against the trends. The trends can be understood with metrics such as moving average, relative strength index, support and resistance, fibonacci, etc. All of these methods are created to do only one thing, which is to generate buy signal when most people start buying it and to sell when most people start selling it, hence earning profit from it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, back to the product A and product B, using technical analysis, it will be better to buy product A than product B, because there are more people looking at the wallet, which makes it easier to sell, and 15 people actively wanting to buy it. While what is cheap in fundamental analysis is the cost in relation to the intrinsic value, what is cheap in technical analysis is its cost in relation to future higher cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To follow the trend is to follow when people start actively wanting it, which is when 15 people actively wanting it. Suppose you stay there 30 minutes, and the number of people wanting to bid drop to 5, while the price had inflated to RM500, this indicates you should stop following the trend and goes against the trend, hence making money out of the investment instrument.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back to Snap, suppose you had heard Snap IPO news, and you had following other similar tech company IPO, and you know that it is going to soar a lot in the first trading day, following technical analysis, the wise thing to do is to apply for IPO stock. Of course, you will need to know the technique to exit. The best exit point can be in a few days, few weeks or few months, depending on the sentiment surround the company and the momentum of the trend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;similarities&quot;&gt;Similarities&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are different, very different. While one suggest buying product A, another suggest to buy product B. However, they do have similarities, which is to gain profit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Practicing value investing will require you to have patience and ability to uncover intrinsic value in order to gain profit. As long as a proper method of evaluating intrinsic value are used, patience is the only thing it takes before other people realizing the intrinsic value of the same company and raise in value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technical analysis, on the other hand, would require skills in evaluating the trends of an instrument, entering and exiting the trade as he sees fit, in order to gain in profit. Patience is not needed, because technical analysis is short-term, and short-term is more of a voting machine than a weighing machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By nature, fundamental analysis, depending on the method of approaches, may require as much as reading news every single day, to as little as reading only the quarterly report once every 3 months. This is all to uncover the potential intrinsic value of a company and making sure the company does not drop in intrinsic value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, technical analysis, depending on time frame, would require monitoring the whole trading day (day trading) to once per every few days (time frame of few months). This is to make sure that one does not miss the right timing to enter or exit the trade and hence making a profit out of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;which-to-choose&quot;&gt;Which to choose&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are people who always argue about technical analysis is much better than fundamental analysis, for the reason that it can earn more profit in a short time. However, in my very own opinion, it depends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are the type of people who are very enthusiastic about earning money and willing to spend a lot of time to monitor your investment instrument, then the technical analysis is the way to go. However, if you just want to grow your money passively, and do not want to care about it, fundamental analysis is surely more suitable for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In investing, what’s right is what makes money, and what’s not right is what doesn’t makes money. If you had chosen the method you prefer, then you have to be consistent in order to make money. But, this does not mean that you cannot have a strategy that is the mix of both. You can have a strategy that uses technical analysis when you are buying and selling and uses fundamental analysis to choose what you want to buy and when you should sell (when the intrinsic value no longer matches the price). Meanwhile, this can generate extra bucks for every single investment, if this is your strategy, then you should stick to it, and not selling it days after buying just because it rose slightly in value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, just look at both, see which are more suitable for you and once you had decided, stick to it, meanwhile learn more about it. Consistency, after all, is what let all those successful investor or trader makes money, not choosing it depending on your mood at that time.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Choosing between fundamental or technical analysis</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="/images/post/2018-10/stock-market.jpeg" /></entry><entry><title type="html">[Movie] Mr. Nobody: Choices</title><link href="/blog/mr-nobody-choices/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="[Movie] Mr. Nobody: Choices" /><published>2018-09-08T00:00:00+08:00</published><updated>2018-09-08T00:00:00+08:00</updated><id>/blog/mr-nobody-choices</id><content type="html" xml:base="/blog/mr-nobody-choices/">&lt;p&gt;Let me start this blog by asking a question:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Is spending your time reading this blog a right choice?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, what is a choice? When we use the word &lt;em&gt;choice&lt;/em&gt;, does it mean we have other alternatives of spending our time besides reading this blog? What are the other alternatives? If there are a lot of other alternatives, why is it a right, or not a right choice to read this blog instead of other alternatives? What is the right choice even mean? Why is one choice more right than the others? What is the metric that we used to measure how right the choice is? What do we even want to achieve in the first place?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are so many questions we need to ask before we are even able to answer that simple question. Imagine, what will happen if the question is much more complex than this? What if the choice that we need to make are very important to our life?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Before he was unable to make a choice because he didn't know what would happen. Now that he knows what will happen, he is unable to make a choice.&quot; — Nemo Nobody&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The whole movie of Mr. Nobody surrounds with the child, Nemo Nobody, at age 9, unable to make a choice between following his dad or mom after they divorce. He then thinks about what could happen if he chooses any one of the choices, and it leads to many different paths of life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image right&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/post/2018-09/train-station-choice.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the beginning, it is only between choosing following his father or mother. If he chooses to follow his mother, he will meet a girl called Anna. Various choices he made will lead him to be together with Anna or not. However, if he chooses to follow his father, he will meet Jean and Elise. Again, various choices he made after that can lead him to be together with either one of them, or neither both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image left&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/post/2018-09/wedding-choices.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of paths being shown in the movie, each is the results of the choices he made. The choices range from something as big as to date Jean or not to date after being rejected by Elise, to as small as confessing his love to Elise 10 seconds earlier or later. This movie shows the effect of the butterfly effect, which is a small change can lead to tremendous differences in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;A single snowflake can bend the leaf of the bamboo&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image right&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/post/2018-09/boiling-eggs.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the movie, the butterfly effect even extends to the choices made by others. At one part of the movie, a factory worker decide to skip work, went home, and boil some eggs. The process of boiling eggs creates extra water vapor in the air, which lead to the rain few days after factory worker incident, exactly at the moment after Nemo receive a card with Anna’s phone number on it, which wash away the ink on the card, causing him to lost the last chance to see Anna again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every choices, one that you made yesterday night for what you going to have for your dinner, one that you made last Monday for should you skip your 8am class, one which you made a few months ago when you choose which new phone to buy, one which your parent choose if to intervene in your choices of course for continuing higher education, or one which your mother choose if she accept your father marriage proposal, would result in completely different outcome depending on the choices being made at that time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We make choices every second of our life, and every single choice we made can result in a completely different outcome. A small mistake might destroy our life, so does a right choice. Beyond that, some of the choices are out of our control too, and these choices that made by someone else could even potentially ruin our day. If so, how can we even make sure that we are on the right path?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image left&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/post/2018-09/chess.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Life choices are like chess. In the beginning, we are all not good at playing chess. We often overlook the strategy of the opponent and lost the game. However, as we play more chess, the better we get at playing chess. The same goes for making life choices. As we grow older, we are better in making the right choices in achieving our goal at that time. Despite that, we might still lose a chess game. There are always people who are more experience than us. The same goes for making life choices, there are just too many variables that we can take into account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a particular chess game, the outcome of the game is totally depending on the choices that made by us and our opponent. To win a chess, not only we need to make the right move, the opponent needs to make the move which in our favors. There are times when we make all the best move we can ever make at that moment, with all the experience we had before that match, we just couldn’t win that match for the simple fact that the opponent is more experienced than us. However, how do we react to that match is also completely up to us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Stoicism, it calls trichotomy of control. There are things that we have full control, things we have partial control and things we do not have control over. Winning a chess game is not something that we have full control over. For instance, the experience our opponent have in chess is totally not in our control. The match can happen when we are 10 years old, and our opponent is the chess world champion of that time, 60 years old, and had been playing chess since 6 years old. We just do not have any control over how many experiences our opponent has. We can’t simply make our opponent into a person who is only playing chess for the first time. If so, why does the experience of our opponent matters in the first place?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Winning the match is not in our total control too. Facing the same opponent, the world champion, even if we are playing chess since the day we born, playing it 18 hours per day, 7 days per week, the difference in experience is just too huge between us and the world champion. Despite our chances of winning is much higher than us playing chess for the first time, it does not guarantee that we will win the chess game. However, practice chess as much as we can, practice a healthy lifestyle so we can have a clear mind when we are playing chess and learn the most out of every match, and trying our hardest to get the most significant out of every single chess match we had is something that we had total control over. So, if we had done that, does winning the match matters anymore?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;In chess, it's called Zugzwang... when the only viable move... is not to move.&quot; — Nemo Nobody&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image right&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/post/2018-09/zugzwang.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to chess rules, we have to make a move whenever it is our turn to make a move. There are times when Zugzwang happens, where the move that we can have is either disadvantage to us or lead us to lose the game. In this situation, choices do exists, but only a limited set of choices, which eventually lead us to the negative outcome of the situation. Facing that situation, no matter how calm we are in that situation, and how aware we are that we had made the best move which we can have in that given situation, we still have to make a choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This leads us to think, how should we make a choice? If losing the game not going to affect our emotion, and all the viable move lead to a negative outcome anyway, how should we choose one over another? Assume there are only 2 viable choices, one which can last us another 5 round before losing the game, another will lead us to lose the game in the next round. Is it more meaningful to last the match as long as possible, be the most persistent person in the world, do not give up until the last moment we can no longer persist anymore, or just lost in the next round, learn the lesson out of the match, move on to the next match, and try to win that match with the sum total experience of all the matches we had before?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Young journalist: Everything you say is contradictory. You can't have been in one place and another at the same time. Of all those lives, which one is the right one?
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Nemo Nobody: Each of these lives is the right one! Every path is the right path. Everything could have been anything else and it would have just as much meaning.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything could have been anything else. The one who had chosen to persist as long as he can could have just lost the game the next round and move on to the next match. The one who had chosen to end the match the next round could have persist as long as he could until the round which he had to lose the game. One is not more meaningful than the other, and the value is up to the person who made the choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same goes for life. I could have been studying hard during secondary school, and be a medical student right now. I could have not continued to pursue my higher education after my high school and is working right now. I could have been anything else, but no one is less real than the other. The me at this moment is the most real me to me at this moment, and that is all matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the chess matches we had, we could have won it all if we are lucky enough. But, those losing match, is also what shape us us, and what potentially contribute to the winning in the future. Each and every single choice we made, is equally meaningful to us, and us alone. It is only us alone that can end up in that exact moment, in that situation, made the decision which we had made in that situation, and it is what makes us unique. There is no single person in the world could have ended up in that situation at that exact moment and made that decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;At my age the candles cost more than the cake. I'm not afraid of dying. I'm afraid I haven't been alive enough. It should be written on every school room blackboard: Life is a playground - or nothing.&quot; — Nemo Nobody&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, nothing matters. Life is a playground, and if it is meaningful to you, it is all that matters.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Everything could've been anything else</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="/images/post/2018-09/mr-nobody-laugh.png" /></entry><entry><title type="html">[Game] Saya no Uta: Aesthetic</title><link href="/blog/game-saya-no-uta-aesthetic/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="[Game] Saya no Uta: Aesthetic" /><published>2018-08-18T00:00:00+08:00</published><updated>2018-08-18T00:00:00+08:00</updated><id>/blog/game-saya-no-uta-aesthetic</id><content type="html" xml:base="/blog/game-saya-no-uta-aesthetic/">&lt;p&gt;In the last post, we had already discussed one of the works of Gen Urobuchi: Fate Zero. Today, we are going to discuss yet another work of Gen Urobuchi, which is Saya no Uta.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saya no Uta is a visual novel, written by Gen Urobuchi, released in 2003. It is later translated to English in 2009. Saya no Uta is one of the signature work of Gen Urobuchi, besides Psycho-Pass, Madoka Magica, and Fate Zero.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a question, which I had been asked several times, in primary school, secondary school, or internet memes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;A curry that looks and taste like shit, a shit that looks and taste like curry, which would you choose?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do not have an answer for that. I fail to answer this question the first time being prompted to it and still fail to answer it now. No matter which choice I choose, it is still equally disgusting. Choosing the curry that we perceive as shit, can we even consume that? Choosing the shit that we perceive as curry, for we had already known the actual content of it, will we able to consume it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gen Urobuchi probably facing difficulties in making a decision for this question and start writing Saya no Uta. Joke aside, let us go through a summary of the story before we discuss this game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spoiler Alert!!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Following blog contains spoiler. If you had not played the game, continue at your own risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of the visual novel, Fuminori had a surgery operate on him after involving in an accident. The surgery leaves him with cognitive disorder due to brain damage. The symptoms of the disorder lead him to perceives the everything as rotten meat and horrific monster. The sense of it is not limited to touch, smell, look, taste and hear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One day, in the hospital, he saw a beautiful young girl who looks like a real human to him. The young girl, not only looks like a human, smell like a human, and touching sensation feels like a human too. However, she is some disgusting monster in reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deep down in Fuminori heart, he knows that she is not what she seems to be. In the game, he can choose to either let Saya heal him, perceiving the world back to what he suppose to perceives, and not able to see Saya anymore, or leaving him as it is, accepts Saya and accepts the world as it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;which-to-choose&quot;&gt;Which to choose?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between curry and shit, we are unable to choose one, because we are not given enough context. Without context, either one seems disgusting to us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the visual novel, the protagonist perceives the floor, the wall, his room, the hospital building, the world, everything, as disgusting, gore, rotten meat, for 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, 365 days per year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine being him, being in the state of prolonged visual disgust, and in the midst of despair, a hope shows up. You see a visually desirable human. This human looks like a young girl, an arguably pretty one, and does not look like those horrific monster that made up from a pile of rotten meat. Since the time after your surgery, which you had already lost track of how long is it before, where it seems forever for you, for the first time, you see something desirable. At that moment, does anything matter anymore? 
in order
Back to the curry and shit, imagine you had the same cognitive disorder. You see the world as disgusting shit. Nothing in the world seems normal to you. You get really hungry. You eat as less as possible, barely enough for survival. You stay idle as long as possible to avoid calories burn. Suddenly, a bowl of curry appear in front of you, would you even bother to know what it actually made up of?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the question that presented to us in this game. How will we act under such circumstances? Will we suicide, or will we go for whatever pleasurable to our senses, or will we stick to the objective aesthetic sense of the object?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might have the answer, but I do not. However, we do not live in such a world, so what matter? Whatever choice you choose, if it is true for you, then it must be true, because the one who is making the choice is you, not me.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Regarding to aesthetic - objective or subjective?</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="/images/post/2018-08/saya-no-uta.jpg" /></entry></feed>
