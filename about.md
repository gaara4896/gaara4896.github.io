## Who I Am

<span class="image left"><img src="{{ "/images/ng_wei_shyang.JPG" | relative_url }}" alt="" /></span>

My name is Ng Wei Shyang and I am a Homo sapiens who born and live in Selangor, Malaysia. People call me Tony, and you can call me Tony too. If anyone tell you that I am `gaara` or `gaara4896`, they confuse username with name. 

I am a programmer by profession. I'm studying computer science in Sunway University and I am also a part of [Sunway Tech Club](https://www.facebook.com/sunwaytechclub/). My focuses are backend, Android and game development. Project that I involved with can be found in [portfolio]({{ "/portfolio/" | relative_url }}) or [Github](https://github.com/gaara4896). 

From times to times, I lead workshop that host by [Sunway Tech Club](https://www.facebook.com/sunwaytechclub/). Some of the workshop that I had lead before are Android Workshop and PyGame workshop. I am also helping out in a lot of other workshop, which include WebLaunch 2018 and Git & Github Workshop. 

I am always open to freelance project opportunity. If you have any freelance project, please contact me through my email or Telegram `@gaara4896`. 

### Philosophy

<span class="image right"><img src="{{ "/images/about/philosophy.jpg" | relative_url }}" alt="" /></span>

I love philosophy. I am interested in different category of philosophy; from general philosophy, political philosophy, ethics to philosophy of life. However, I am not a practitioner of any branch of philosophy, at least not yet. 

Despite I am not a practitioner of specific branch of philosophy, I am a practitioner of my own philosophy. I take what I think right from any branch of philosophy and denied otherwise. For instance, I agree with utilitarianism in making decision based on greatest good to greatest amount of people, but I disagree with looking people at collective way and seeing them as just a container of happiness. I agree with stoicism in embracing suffering as part of life; not for the reason of easier in attaining pleasure; but for the reason as a chance of achieving greater version of ourself. 

### Hobby
